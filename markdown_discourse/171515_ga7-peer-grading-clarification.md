@carlton Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.

Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a "You need access" screen from Google Sheets. It includes UI elements for requesting access to a Google Sheet. There's also a stylized illustration on the right side.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **"Google Sheets"** (with the Google Sheets icon)
*   **"You need access"**
*   **"Request access, or switch to an account with access."**
*   **"Learn more"** (as a link)
*   **"Message (optional)"** (as a placeholder in a text input field)
*   **"Request access"** (on a blue button)
*   **"You're signed in as"**
*   **"22f2000644@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"** (an email address)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The screen indicates that the user does not have permission to view the Google Sheet they are trying to access. The user is prompted to request access, with an option to include a message. The screen also shows the Google account the user is currently signed in with.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The image shows a standard UI pattern for access control in Google products.
*   The email address suggests the user is a student at IIT Madras (iitm.ac.in).
*   The "Message (optional)" field allows the user to provide context for their access request.
*   The "Request access" button would likely trigger an email notification to the owner of the Google Sheet.
*   The illustration is a modern, flat-style graphic, likely intended to add visual interest and communicate the concept of access or entry.

Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a list of tasks, likely instructions for an assignment or project. The tasks are numbered and written in plain text.

**2. Text Content:**

The text content is as follows:

*   **Tasks:**
*   **1.** Create a **new blank Google Sheet workbook**, named **ga.7.1.rollno** (replace 'rollno' with your IITM roll number excluding the domain).
*   **2.** Share with editing rights to se2002@study.iitm.ac.in. If you do not do this step first, **on a blank workbook** we will not consider your submission.

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The purpose of the text is to provide clear instructions to a student or user. The instructions involve creating a Google Sheet and sharing it with a specific email address. The emphasis on creating a "blank workbook" and sharing it first suggests that the submission will be evaluated based on the initial state of the sheet. The warning about not considering the submission if the sharing step is not done first highlights the importance of following the instructions precisely.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The instructions are specific to Google Sheets, a web-based spreadsheet application.
*   The naming convention for the Google Sheet is specified as "ga.7.1.rollno," where "rollno" is to be replaced with the user's IITM roll number (excluding the domain).
*   The email address provided (se2002@study.iitm.ac.in) is likely the instructor's or teaching assistant's email address for submission purposes.
*   The phrase "editing rights" indicates that the shared Google Sheet should allow the recipient to make changes to the document.
