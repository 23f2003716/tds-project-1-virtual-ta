        1.  Convert degrees to radians (formula: `radians = (π/180) * degrees`)
        2.  Calculate differences in latitude and longitude (formulas: `Δφ = φ2 - φ1; Δλ = λ2 - λ1`)
        3.  Apply the Haversine formula (formula provided).
        *   Defines `r` as the radius of the Earth (6371 km).
    *   **Student:** "Yes, I converted the latitude and longitude for Location A and Location B to radians. Here's what I got:"
