Hi Team,

I understand there have been 2 TA-led sessions on 16th and 17th Jan, however the recordings were not found in the playlist - [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C)

Please help if these were recorded or if the link is wrong. Thanks in advance!
