Hi Sahil,

Please find it at the following location.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-01-12 at 18.25.31**
The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a course website or learning management system (LMS) interface.Â 

Here's a breakdown of the content:

1. **UI Elements:** The screenshot displays a sidebar navigation menu on the left and main content area on the right. The sidebar has a search bar and a hierarchical list of topics related to "Tools in Data Science," including subcategories like "Development Tools," "Large Language Models," and "Data Visualization." The main content area is divided into sections: information about teaching assistants, course links, and January 2025-specific links.

2. **Text Content:** The text includes:

    * **Title:** "Tools in Data Science" (at the top of the sidebar)
    * **Search Bar Placeholder:** "Type to search"
    * **Sidebar Menu Items:**  A list of topics related to data science tools, organized hierarchically.
    * **Teaching Assistant Information:** Names, email addresses, and contact information for teaching assistants, including a virtual TA powered by GPT.  A statement emphasizes their availability for student questions.
    * **Course Links:** Links to a discussion forum ("TDS Discourse"), a student handbook, and the course's public homepage.
    * **Jan 2025 Links:**  A list of links specific to January 2025, including links to grading documents, course pages, calendars, announcements, course materials (Jupyter notebooks and datasets), and a YouTube playlist for TA sessions.  The "TDS" prefix likely stands for "Tools in Data Science."

3. **Context/Purpose:** The screenshot shows a course outline or resource page for a "Tools in Data Science" course. It provides students with access to course materials, communication channels, and contact information for support. The organization suggests a structured learning environment.

4. **Technical Details:** There are no code snippets or technical diagrams. The screenshot shows a user interface (UI) designed for easy navigation and access to course resources.  The use of hyperlinks (indicated by the underlined text) is evident.

In summary, the image is a snapshot of a well-organized online course page designed to provide students with easy access to course information and resources. The structure and content suggest a focus on practical tools and techniques within the field of data science.

Kind regards
