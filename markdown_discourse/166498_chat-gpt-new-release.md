Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited  :stuck_out_tongue: 

Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important -  the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to @s.anand and the entire course team who designed this amazing course

I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next  :slight_smile:

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a development environment, likely an online IDE or a code editor with integrated chat functionality. It's split into three main sections:

*   **Left Panel:** A chat interface, presumably with a chatbot like ChatGPT.
*   **Middle Panel:** A code editor displaying Python code.
*   **Bottom Panel:** A console output window.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Chat Interface (Left Panel):**
    *   "ChatGPT 4o" (likely the name of the chatbot)
    *   "refine the solution further."
    *   "Let me know how I can assist you in addressing the issue!"
    *   "Edited"
    *   "I've updated the code to handle environments without SSL by including a workaround for SSL configuration using `certifi` and checking the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable. This should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'` issue."
    *   "Let me know if you encounter further issues or need additional adjustments!"
    *   "Message ChatGPT"
    *   "ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info"

*   **Code Editor (Middle Panel):**
    *   "Wiki Outline Api" (likely the name of the script)
    *   `"""Fetch the Wikipedia page of a country and generate a Markdown outline."""` (docstring)
    *   `try:`
    *   `# Format the Wikipedia URL`
    *   `wiki_url = f"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{country.replace(' ', '_')}"`
    *   `# Fetch the Wikipedia page`
    *   `response = requests.get(wiki_url)`
    *   `if response.status_code != 200:`
    *   `return JSONResponse(`
    *   `content={"error": "Unable to fetch Wikipedia page for the specified country."},`
    *   `status_code=404,`
    *   `)`
    *   `# Parse the HTML content`
    *   `soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")`
    *   `# Extract headings (H1 to H6
