@24ds3000061 @22f2001532

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.

GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

Kind regards

You got 80 in ga4. And the bonus makes it to 90.

Thats what we have on our system.

Kindly post a screenshot of your dashboard if 90 is not showing for GA4

    *   "Week 3 Assignment - 58.00"

The image doesn't contain any code or technical diagrams. It's a UI screenshot, likely from a web-based learning platform. The assignment scores are displayed as numerical values with two decimal places, suggesting a percentage or grade format.

Dont worry we have your correct scores. We have done spot checks to make sure of the data consistency. We are having some technical difficulties with getting the evaluations which are on the TDS server to the Portal Operations team. Kindly bear with us while we work out the problem.

(Its a data cleaning and packaging issue - a typical TDS problem  :rofl: )

I have completed and checked and even saved the assignment for GA2 and GA3, however it says that I was absent for both GA2 and GA3.

Please check my assignment and ensure that it has been corrected, since I have checked the website and I had submitted.

I have attended the Graded Assignment for Tools in Data Science for the week 4 and the saved scores says i have got 2 marks. ( TDS 2025 Jan GA4 - Data Sourcing).

But in the evaluation it says i have not submitted the GA4 from this course. Can you please clarify the same.

Attached the screenshots for both

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web interface, likely for an online course or assignment. It displays information about bonus marks, login status, and recent saves. The interface has a dark theme.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Top Bar:**
    *   "Ended at Sun, 9 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"
    *   "Score: 0"
    *   "Check all"
    *   "Save"
*   **Bonus Marks Section:**
    *   "Bonus marks for posting on Discourse"
    *   "To encourage discussions, IITM BS students who reply to the discussion on GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] with a relevant question or reply will get 1 bonus mark on this graded assignment."
*   **Login Information:**
    *   "You are logged in as 23f1002510@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."
    *   "Logout" (button)
*   **Recent Saves Section:**
    *   "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)"

    *   "Reload from 09/02/2025, 23:56:35. Score: 2"
    *   "Reload from 09/02/2025, 23:44:29. Score: 2"
*   **Bottom Right (Windows Taskbar):**
    *   "19:29"
    *   "18-02-2025"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The interface appears to be part of an online learning platform, possibly related to a course at IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras). The purpose is to:

*   Inform students about bonus marks available for participating in a specific discussion thread on Discourse.
*   Display the user's login status.
*   Show a history of recent saves, likely related to the assignment

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

@22f3000935 I can confirm that your score 77.5 was after midnight of the deadline. Your actual score before the deadline it was 70.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 10.57.15 am**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays what appears to be a table or a list of records. Each row contains several data fields. The data is presented in a tabular format, with each column representing a different attribute.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The text content in the image includes the following:

*   `tds-2025-01-ga1` (repeated in each row)
*   `22f3000935@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` (repeated in each row)
*   `2025-01-27 00:00:23` (appears twice)
*   `2025-01-26 23:59:01` (appears twice)
*   `7.75` (appears twice)
*   `7` (appears twice)
*   `10` (appears in each row)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The data likely represents some kind of record or entry, possibly related to a study or project at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM), given the domain `iitm.ac.in`. The fields could represent:

*   `tds-2025-01-ga1`: An identifier or code for a specific test or data set.
*   `22f3000935@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`: An email address, possibly associated with a student or researcher.
*   `2025-01-27 00:00:23` and `2025-01-26 23:59:01`: Timestamps, likely indicating the date and time of an event or measurement.
*   `7.75` and `7`: Numerical values, possibly representing scores, measurements, or quantities.
*   `10`: Another numerical value, potentially a maximum score, a count, or a category.

**4. Technical details:**

Without further context, it's difficult to provide specific technical details. However, based on the data structure, it could be:

because the previous score that you received was what you scored after the deadline. We had accidentally given students marks to students who submitted after the deadline. Here is the evidence.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 11.59.39 am**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a table or a data grid, likely from a user interface. It displays information related to quizzes, email addresses, timestamps, total scores, and maximum possible scores.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The table has the following column headers:
*   Quiz
*   Email
*   Time
*   Total
*   Max

The table contains two rows of data:

*   **Row 1:**
    *   Quiz: tds-2025-01-ga3
    *   Email: 21f3000745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
    *   Time: 2025-02-06 18:53:58
    *   Total: 7
    *   Max: 9.5
*   **Row 2:**
    *   Quiz: tds-2025-01-ga3
    *   Email: 21f3000745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
    *   Time: 2025-02-05 22:01:38
    *   Total: 6
    *   Max: 9.5

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The data likely represents quiz results for a student or a group of students. The table shows the quiz name, the student's email address, the time the quiz was taken, the total score obtained, and the maximum possible score for the quiz. It appears that the same student took the same quiz twice, resulting in two entries.

**4. Technical details:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a UI element, possibly from a web application or a desktop application. The table structure suggests that the data is likely stored in a database and retrieved for display. The "Time" column header has a small triangle next to it, which may indicate that the table can be sorted by the "Time" column.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a UI element that appears to be part of an online learning platform or course management system. It displays information about modules, assignments, and scores.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Module 1: Development Tools**
*   **Assignment**
*   **Graded Assignment 1**
*   **Assessment (Due: 26 Jan 2025)**
*   **Submitted**
*   **Your Score**
*   **Peer Average**
*   **Median Score**
*   **100** (under "Your Score")
*   **99%** (under "Peer Average")
*   **100** (under "Median Score")
*   **View Chart** (appears twice, under "Your Score" and "Peer Average")
*   **Module 2: Deployment Tools**

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The UI element is likely displaying a student's performance on a specific assignment ("Graded Assignment 1") within a module ("Module 1: Development Tools"). It shows the student's score (100), the average score of their peers (99%), and the median score (100). The "Submitted" text indicates that the student has already submitted the assignment. The "View Chart" links likely lead to visual representations of the score distribution. The presence of "Module 2: Deployment Tools" suggests that this is part of a larger course with multiple modules.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The layout is tabular, with columns for "Your Score," "Peer Average," and "Median Score."
*   The assignment name ("Graded Assignment 1") is likely a hyperlink.
*   The "View Chart" elements are also likely hyperlinks.
*   The UI uses a clean, modern design with a light background.
*   The arrow next to "Module 1: Development Tools" suggests that the module details can be expanded or collapsed.
*   The arrow next to "Module 2: Deployment Tools" suggests that the module details can be expanded or collapsed.

@23f2004320

I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1.

Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks.

The actual score will be in the dashboard soon.

Kind regards.

@23f1002223

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-20 at 7.52.54 am**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays what appears to be a table or a list of data entries. Each entry consists of several fields arranged horizontally. The background is a light gray, and the text is black.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The text content in the image includes the following fields for each entry:

*   `tds-2025-01-ga3` (appears to be an identifier or name)
*   `23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` (likely an email address)
*   A date and time stamp in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (e.g., `2025-02-06 01:13:34`)
*   A numerical value (either `4.5` or `3.5`)
*   The numerical value `9.5`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The data likely represents some kind of records or logs. The fields suggest that it could be related to:

*   **Data processing or analysis:** The "tds" prefix might stand for "time-domain signal" or a similar data type.
*   **User activity or performance:** The email address could identify a user, and the numerical values might represent scores, ratings, or other metrics.
*   **System logs:** The timestamp indicates when an event occurred, and the other fields could provide context about the event.

**4. Technical details:**

Given the format of the data, it's likely that this information is stored in a database or a structured data file (e.g., CSV, JSON). The image is a visual representation of a subset of that data. The consistent format of the date and time suggests that it's being handled programmatically.

According to your submission history your last submission before the deadline was 3.5 (i.e. your score would be 36.8 out of 100)

@shubham6 I have checked the backend server. It does show your score as 8 for GA2, so we have the correct score for you.

Can you send me a screenshot of your dashboard (where your course cards are) thanks.

Kind regards
