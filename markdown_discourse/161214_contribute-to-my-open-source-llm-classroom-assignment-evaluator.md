Dear all,

I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in Data Science * course: [**LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator**](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom).  This is the basic prototype.

This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.

A heartfelt thanks to **@s.anand**, our course instructor, and TAs **@Carlton** and **@Jivraj**, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.

I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:

Expand functionality and evaluation models.
Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
Improve documentation for broader accessibility.

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom) is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!

Update: here is a video explaining the process - [https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared)

Best regards,

Avinash Shrivastava

Hi Avinash,

Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this approach. I see a lot of potential in this project.

Kind regards
