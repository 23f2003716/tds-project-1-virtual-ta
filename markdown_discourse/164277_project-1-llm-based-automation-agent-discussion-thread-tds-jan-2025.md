Please post any questions related to [Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-1).

Deadline: Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM

**Update on 27 Jan 2025**:

A *sample* evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at [tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1)

You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.

Please note:

This is a sample. It **WILL** change.
Don’t rely on the dataset being the same. It **WILL** change.
LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:

Your code gives correct results *reliably* (i.e. try a few times)
Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations

Your [AI Proxy usage](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
For those who [submit their code](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOaljgV-INdbKrPotV9OMUKV01QVaFEfcnr5dAxBZqM4x37g/viewform?usp=dialog) by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-01-23 151614**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a set of instructions, likely from a tutorial or documentation, displayed in a dark-themed text editor or presentation. The instructions involve installing and running a Python script.

**2. Text Content:**

The text content is as follows:

*   "A1. Install `uv` (if required) and run"
*   "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py"
*   "with `${user.email}` as the only argument. (NOTE: This will generate data files required for the next tasks.)"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The context is likely a tutorial or set of instructions for a data science course or project. The purpose of the instructions is to guide the user in setting up the environment and generating necessary data files. The instruction A1 suggests that the user may need to install a tool called `uv` before running the Python script. The script `datagen.py` is intended to generate data files, and it requires the user's email address as an argument. The note emphasizes that this step is crucial for the subsequent tasks.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The URL points to a Python script named `datagen.py` hosted on GitHub under the repository `tools-in-data-science-public` by the user `sanand0`. The repository seems to be related to a course or project named `tds-2025-01`.
*   The instruction specifies that the script should be run with `${user.email}` as the only argument. This suggests that the user's email address is required for the script to function correctly, possibly for identification, data generation, or other purposes.
*   The script is likely a data generation script, as indicated by the filename `datagen.py` and the note stating that it will generate data files.

sir @Jivraj after editing line 127 in datagen.py i got those  required data files. is it allowed ? also i had to run datagen.py MANUALLY(is this process also should be automatic)?

Hi Guddu ,

I didn’t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?

command that I used :

`uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data`

here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.

Kind regards

Jivraj

Hi Aishik,

Pls add context to your query, without that we won’t be able to understand, where exactly you are facing problem.

 23f2005325:

openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}

Possible reasons for this issue:

Not using anand sir’s proxy url for sending requests.
Token not being correct.

While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest_number> file? Please clarify.

do we have to do these tasks in the linux? As in some of the GA1, the linux answers only accepted. Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or we have to use linux?

The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.

For more information watch this video [https://youtu.be/q74CP4fB7cY?si=M_zw8WzpmMCyVQat](https://youtu.be/q74CP4fB7cY?si=M_zw8WzpmMCyVQat) or watch TDS Live Sessions.

Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:

Deliverables,

and *an example* of the Evaluation has been provided.

If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a list of deliverables and related instructions, likely for a programming or software development task. It includes a list of tasks to be completed, followed by notes and instructions. The list is visually separated by bullet points. The top section is enclosed in a red box.

**2. Text Content:**

The image contains the following text:

*   **Deliverables** (Title)
*   **Create a new GitHub repository.**
*   **Add an MIT LICENSE file**
*   **Write and test your code. Call POST /run?task=... with a few tasks and check if GET /read?path=... creates the correct files.**
*   **Commit and push your code**
*   **Create a Dockerfile that builds your application**
*   **Publish your Docker image publicly to Docker Hub**
*   **Ensure that running your image via podman run $IMAGE\_NAME -e AIPROXY\_TOKEN=$AIPROXY\_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 automatically serves the API at http://localhost:8000/run?task=... and http://localhost:8000/read?path=...**
*   **Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository ( https://github.com/user-name/repo-name ) and the URL of your Docker image ( user-name/repo-name )**
*   **Note:**
*   **Use the AIPROXY\_TOKEN environment variable. DON'T commit your Al Proxy token to your repository. Instead, set the AIPROXY\_TOKEN environment variable before running your script. Use os.environ \["AIPROXY\_TOKEN"] as the token in your script.**
*   **Use your Al Proxy token. Your Al Proxy token now has a $1 limit. You may use it. If you run out of tokens, ask the TDS team for more. (But try and avoid that.)**
*   **Stick to GPT-4o-Mini. This is the only generation model that Al Proxy currently supports. When this page says "LLM", it means GPT-4o-Mini.**
*   **Keep your prompts short and concise. Each call to /run and /read must complete within

Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.

Kind regards

You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks.

by clicking the link

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) element, likely from a web application or software program. It appears to be a section related to a project, specifically "Project 1". There are two main parts:

*   **Left Side:** A navigation or menu section. It lists "Project 1" twice. The first instance of "Project 1" has a small, empty circle to its left, suggesting it might be a top-level category or a collapsible section. The second instance of "Project 1" has a clock icon to its left and the word "Assignment" below it.
*   **Right Side:** A question and a radio button. The question is about whether the user has seen and attempted "Project 1" at a specific link.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   "Project 1" (appears multiple times)
*   "Assignment"
*   "1) I have seen Project 1 available at this link and have attempted it."
*   "this link" (appears as a hyperlink)
*   "Yes"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The UI seems to be part of a project management or assignment tracking system. The left side likely allows users to navigate between different projects or sections within a project. The right side presents a question to the user, asking if they have accessed and attempted a specific project (Project 1) available at a given link. The "Yes" radio button allows the user to confirm that they have.

**4. Technical details (UI elements):**

*   **Collapsible Section:** The upward-pointing arrow next to the first "Project 1" suggests that this section can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide its contents.
*   **Hyperlink:** "this link" is likely a clickable hyperlink that would direct the user to the location of "Project 1".
*   **Radio Button:** The empty circle next to "Yes" is a radio button, indicating that the user can select this option to answer the question.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a webpage or document related to a data science project. It appears to be a project description or assignment within a larger course or learning module. The left side of the image shows a navigation menu, while the right side displays the main content of the "Background" section for "Project 1."

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Navigation Menu (Left):**
    *   "Tools in Data Science" (title)
    *   Search bar with "Type to search" placeholder
    *   "Tools in Data Science" (collapsed)
    *   "Development Tools" (expanded)
    *   "Deployment Tools" (expanded)
    *   "Large Language Models" (expanded)
    *   "Project 1" (expanded)
        *   "Background" (selected, highlighted in red)
        *   "Create an API"
        *   "Phase A: Handle Operatio..." (truncated)
        *   "Phase B: Handle Business..." (truncated)
        *   "Deliverables"

*   **Main Content (Right):**
    *   "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" (title)
    *   "This project is due on 15 Feb 2025 EOD IST. Results will be announced by 25 Feb 2025."
    *   "For questions, use this Discourse thread." (with "this Discourse thread" as a hyperlink)
    *   "Background" (section title)
    *   "You have joined the operations team at DataWorks Solutions, a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts to generate actionable insights for internal stakeholders. In order to improve operational efficiency and consistency, the company has mandated that routine tasks be automated and integrated into their Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline."
    *   "Due to the unpredictable nature of incoming data (from logs, ticket systems, source code, surveys, etc.) the team has decided to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer. In this role, the LLM..." (truncated)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image presents the background information for a data science

I am getting this opened.

Hi @Divya1 ,

There won’t be any project1 page such as GA1s, there is a google form(which can be found in same page) which needs to be filled after you do project1.

Hi @23f2005325 ,

Extracting details from credit cards is sensitive, try using strong prompts or take code from LLM and execute it in script.

Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environment using maybe ollama(local llm as now there is deepseek opensource, i doubt we would need to use openai for testing, just for production(test submission)  would be enough) and also some agent(langchain, autogen, crewai) just a quick how-to on setting up and problems while setting up if possible

More resources on docker. Using docker as a virtual environment. Editing and executing code in Dockerfiles (like when you change code in src a web framework automatically reloads page(hot reload)), something along the lines of this .

In Tuesday’s(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of session.

What was discussed in that live session regarding docker:

Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.
Pull an existing docker image.
Run that image inside a container.
Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)
Once done you can commit it.
And push customized container’s image to docker hub.

Regarding local models running for project1, it’s a good idea, we will see if it’s possible to discuss in session.

Hi @Divya1

**Image: Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 8.19.05 am**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a list of deliverables, likely for a programming assignment or project. The list is formatted as bullet points. There's a title "Deliverables" at the top, accompanied by a red star icon. The last bullet point is enclosed in a red rounded rectangle, emphasizing it.

**2. Any text content visible:**

Here's a breakdown of the text content:

*   **Title:** "Deliverables"
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   "Create a new *public* GitHub repository."
    *   "Add an MIT LICENSE file"
    *   "Write and test your code. Call `POST /run?task=...` with a few tasks and check if `GET /read?path=...` creates the correct files."
    *   "Commit and push your code"
    *   "Create a Dockerfile that builds your application"
    *   "Publish your Docker image *publicly* to Docker Hub"
    *   "Ensure that running your image via `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000` automatically serves the API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`"
    *   "Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository (`https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`) and your Docker image name (`user-name/repo-name`)"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image outlines the steps required to complete a programming project. It includes creating a GitHub repository, writing and testing code, creating a Dockerfile, publishing the Docker image, and ensuring the image runs correctly. The final step is to submit the GitHub repository URL and Docker image name via a Google Form.

**4. Technical details (code snippets):**

*   **API Calls:** The image mentions making `POST` and `GET` requests to specific endpoints:
    *   `POST /run?task=...`
    *   `GET /read?path=...`
*   **Docker:** The

Please do very carefully all things mentioned in the Deliverables as well as look at the Evaluation Section.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 8.26.08 am**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **UI Elements:** The image displays a list of prerequisites, likely from a document or webpage. The list is formatted with bullet points and sub-bullets. Certain keywords are highlighted with a gray background.

2.  **Text Content:**
    *   "Here's how we will score the results."
    *   "Pre-requisites: Your repository MUST meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation"
    *   "Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible"
    *   "Your GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license"
    *   "Your GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile"
    *   "Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via"
    *   "podman run $IMAGE\_NAME -e AIPROXY\_TOKEN=$AIPROXY\_TOKEN -p 8000:8000"
    *   "Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository"

3.  **Context/Purpose:** The image outlines the requirements that a GitHub repository and its associated Docker image must meet to be considered for evaluation. This suggests a competition, assessment, or automated grading system.

4.  **Technical Details:**
    *   The highlighted text "LICENSE" and "Dockerfile" indicate that the repository must contain these files.
    *   The "podman run" command shows how the Docker image should be run. It uses environment variables (AIPROXY\_TOKEN) and port mapping (8000:8000). The $IMAGE\_NAME is a placeholder for the actual image name. This command suggests that the Docker image is expected to expose a service on port 8000.
    *   The use of "podman" suggests a containerization environment similar to Docker, but potentially with different security or resource management characteristics.

We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project.

If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned **especially the pre - requisites** mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project and *there will be no appeal* for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the evaluation criteria.

In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables mentioned above.

Kind regards

i updated the libffi package using sudo but while breaking something else can someone pls help me? @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand

history of commands in new codespace

    1  crewai --version
    2  pip install crewai crewai-tools
    3  python3 -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)"
    4  export PATH=/opt/conda/bin:$PATH
    5  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/conda/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    6  python3 -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)"
    7  crewai create crew <project_name>
    8  crewai create crew b2b
    9  history

UPDATE: IT’s WORKING if you do this in order

    1  python3 -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)"
    2  export PATH=/opt/conda/bin:$PATH
    3  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/conda/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    4  python3 -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)"
    5  pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall typing_extensions pydantic crewai crewai-tools
    6  conda install -c conda-forge typing_extensions
    7  exec bash
    8  crewai create crew "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent"

Something about different environment conda and python can the instructors please help me understand it(resources ), so i can trouble shoot this later with better accuracy come precision

Hi @23f1002382,

Yes datagen.py must be present in same directory from where you  are executing evaluate.py.

Oh, You trying to use crewai locally for Project1

Hi @JoelJeffrey ,

Filepath is unique for every file, which needs to be inserted to json file.

Ok. So just to confirm, since there are files with the same name, the json file should map the filepath and not the filename to the title right?

**Image: Screenshot from 2025-01-31 12-25-29**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a text-based instruction or task description, likely from a programming or data processing context. It also includes an example of a JSON data structure.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The text content can be broken down as follows:

*   "A6. Find all Markdown (.md) files in /data/docs/. For each file, extract the first header line (the first line starting with #). Create an index file /data/docs/index.json that maps each filename (without the path) to its title (e.g."
*   `{"README.md": "Home", "large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image describes a task that involves processing Markdown files within a specific directory (`/data/docs/`). The goal is to create an index file (in JSON format) that associates each Markdown filename with its corresponding title (extracted from the first header line of the file). The example JSON shows how the index file should be structured.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **Markdown (.md):** This refers to files written in the Markdown markup language, a lightweight language used for formatting text.
*   **/data/docs/:** This is a directory path, indicating the location where the Markdown files are stored.
*   **Header line (starting with #):** In Markdown, a line starting with `#` indicates a header. The number of `#` symbols determines the header level (e.g., `#` for a top-level header, `##` for a second-level header, etc.).
*   **/data/docs/index.json:** This is the path to the index file that needs to be created. It will be in JSON format.
*   **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** This is a standard text-based format for representing structured data. The example shows a JSON object where keys are filenames (e.g., "README.md") and values are the corresponding titles (e.g., "Home"). The `...` indicates that the JSON object may contain more key-value pairs.

no crewai, it takes really long i put time out for 300 secs(in run(task:str) in evaluate.py) still sometimes its not enough. I’ll try with autogen next and then langchain

Hi Guddu,

We are planning several project sessions in order to show the workflow of creating a successful project.

Although you are returning a 200 ok, the get request file must match the expectation. In other words after running the first task for example, has the new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output.

In this case you would write out the the `expected` variable in the `evaluate.py` and see if `result` variable matches the `expected`. Then you can figure out what went wrong.

Kind regards

Ok sir

But please try to take those sessions sooner

Because it’s taking too much time for me to do any problem(plus two more courses and one oppe you know) .so I just want to build the project before deadline.

the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic “ls” command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key.

Do you think we could access a better model?

Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y’all run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?

because the model doesn’t know basic commands after telling how to do it.

So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question.

I spent a week on this just saying

Hello, I recently started working on the project. I understood how to do all the phase A tasks on a high level but I’m struggling to start the implementation of the first task in phase A. I’m confused mainly about how the /data directory is supposed to be created, I don’t know how to generate the data and a little confused about the output formats. I would appreciate if I could get in contact with anyone who could guide me in the right direction.

Hello everyone, @s.anand @carlton

I had a few queries regarding the project;

I am preloading my docker image with uv and generating the /data files when the container is ran. For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that’s already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine?
For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like “path=/data/format.md” or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like “path=show the data in format.md”?
Are we concerned about what’s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?
For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they’re flexible? Ex. “Count the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt”

For Project-1 to complete, it requires:

"You MUST complete ALL these 3 steps to get a score. Failure to do so will result in getting 0 in the project. If you do not do ALL these 3 steps before the deadline, there will be no appeal available.

• Fill the form that is on the Project Page

But I did not get the form; where is it? While I checked inside the project pages also.

@s.anand sir, I see that the project 1 timeline was changed from February 7 - 17, 2025 to January 17 - February 15 which undoubtedly is a good increase in duration. However, I have my GATE DA exam on Feb 15 and the exam center is unexpectedly far. So, I request you to consider pushing the deadline to at least Feb 16. If not, I’ll still do my best.

Is the proxy server down right now?

I am getting this error when I am accessing the endpoint:

@21f3002390 - AI Proxy is working and you *did* get the result. You can ignore any `costError`. It won’t happen in the future anyway.

**What’s happening?** I was trying to generate a unique hash for each request, as a precursor to caching requests. But I made a mistake in the code. Specifically, `crypto.createHash` is not supported in CloudFlare. [I fixed that](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy/commit/5943b6d355deffff88ac07d17aa0c6969cacc3d5) by removing this. I’ll introduce caching later if required.

For the question #A8 on recognizing the credit card number in the image, Open AI doesn’t seem to be recognizing the number correctly and as a result the evaluation is failing. What should be the solution?

**Image: image**
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a terminal output, likely from a script or program interacting with a local server. It shows a sequence of HTTP requests and responses, along with some expected and actual results. The overall process seems to involve extracting a credit card number from an image using a Large Language Model (LLM).

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Task Description:** "Running task: `/data/credit_card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt`"
*   **HTTP Request (POST):** "POST http://localhost:8000/run?task=%60%2Fdata%2Fcredit\_card.png%60+contains+a+credit+card+number.+Pass+the+image+to+an+LLM%2C+have+it+extract+the+card+number%2C+and+write+it+without+spaces+to+%60%2Fdata%2Fcredit-card.txt%60 "HTTP/1.1 200 OK""
*   **HTTP Response (200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
        "function": "extract_numbers_from_image",
        "arguments": {
            "input_file_path": "/data/credit_card.png",
            "output_file_path": "/data/credit-card.txt"
        }
    }
    ```
*   **HTTP Request (GET):** "GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/credit-card.txt "HTTP/1.1 200 OK""
*   **File Content:** "/data/credit-card.txt"
*   **Expected Result:** "4026399336539356"
*   **Actual Result:** "402639933635936"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows a test or execution log of a process designed to:

1.  Take an image (`/data/credit

A query regarding the task description in the query given to LLM for phase A.

For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be counted?

Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM.

Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal.

The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks.

We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday.

Kind regards

how to handle this error

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal window, likely running on a Linux or Unix-like system. It displays a command that was executed, followed by a Python traceback and an error message.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Command:** `root@Vikash:/mnt/e/IITM/New/TDS/LLM_Project# OPENAI_API_KEY=$AIPROXY_TOKEN uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanando/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/evaluate.py`
*   **Traceback:**
    *   `Traceback (most recent call last):`
    *   `File "/tmp/evaluatewEpC39.py", line 20, in `
    *   `from datagen import (`
    *   `......`
    *   `)`
*   **Error Message:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'datagen'`
*   **Current Directory:** `root@Vikash:/mnt/e/IITM/New/TDS/LLM_Project#`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows an attempt to run a Python script named `evaluate.py`. The script is being executed using `uv run` and is fetched from a remote URL on GitHub. The script is failing because it's trying to import a module named `datagen`, which Python cannot find. This indicates that the `datagen` module is either not installed, not in the Python path, or the module name is misspelled. The command also sets an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the value of `$AIPROXY_TOKEN`.

**4. Technical details (code screenshot):**

*   The traceback indicates that the error occurs on line 20 of the file `/tmp/evaluatewEpC39.py`.
*   The error is a `ModuleNotFoundError`, which is a standard Python exception raised when an import statement fails to find the specified module.
*   The `from datagen import (...)` statement suggests that the script is trying to import specific functions or classes from

expected = sum(1 for date in dates if parse(date).weekday() == 2)
    if result.strip() != str(expected):
        return mismatch("/data/dates-wednesdays.txt", expected, result)
    return True```

 :red_circle:  /data/dates-wednesdays.txt

 :warning:  EXPECTED:

129

 :warning:  RESULT:

“129”

If it is expecting str then why throw error sir  ? @carlton  @Jivraj

or just tell me how to pass count as an int here

with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(str(count))

@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj

**I am getting below error message from LLM end points [https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions](https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions) or [https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings)** , while running my project .

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a snippet of text, likely from a console or log output. The text appears to be a JSON-like structure representing an error message.

**2. Text Content:**

The text content is as follows:

```
{'error': 'API Error: 429, {\n "message": "On 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2"\n}'}
```

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The displayed text represents an error response from an API. The error indicates that a usage limit has been exceeded. Specifically, the message states that on February 2025, a value of $2.002295600000011 was used, exceeding a limit of $2. The "429" error code typically signifies "Too Many Requests," often used for rate limiting or exceeding usage quotas.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **JSON-like Structure:** The text resembles a JSON object, with a key-value pair where the key is "error." The value associated with "error" is a string containing the error message.
*   **API Error Code:** The "API Error: 429" indicates a standard HTTP status code for rate limiting or exceeding usage limits.
*   **Error Message:** The error message provides specific details about the exceeded limit, including the date, the amount used, and the limit itself.
*   **Newline Characters:** The `\n` characters within the string suggest that the message is formatted to include line breaks when displayed.

Kindly help me to resolve this issue.  :cry:

@carlton Will there be evaluation script for tasks in group B also?

Some questions about ‘B’ group tasks:

Q1: For the following tasks (B5, B7, B9, and B10) tasks, how will input files be provided? Will it be URL or will `datagen.py` also generate files for these?

Q2: For the above tasks as well as for B6 ( Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website), how should output be returned?

Q3: In task B8, for transcribing audio file, which Python package is recommended or do we need to use OpenAI API?

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database

B7. Compress or resize an image

B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file

B9. Convert Markdown to HTML

B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

its expecting to  match every single detail in that even " and ’ .

in that case changing evaluate.py will result in zero or less marks.

llm will only handle  -calling function based on query and parameter   . What is it going to do about the logic of functions.

If i still focus on passing evaluate.py will it be any good sir @carlton @s.anand

Sorry, sir, not trying to be rude, but there isn’t a single full-fledged project session. It’s a bit difficult to dive into the project without guidance on how to do it. It would be nice to have a full project session where we can start a project from the beginning and follow it to completion.

We will be doing project session on Tuesday 9 Feb [correction] Tuesday 11th of Feb (thanks @23f1002382 @23f2000237) . Project 1 uses the things you learnt in week 1-3. But mostly week 2 & 3.

We dont do it in the beginning, (but introduced it 2 weeks ago in a live session), to give students chance to practise the new learnings from week 2 & 3.

The plan has always been to demonstrate a few tasks and have you try doing the rest.

Kind regards

Hi Aindree,

No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written it clearly means it was *updated* on 27th January. The update being that the evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it.

Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

Kind regards

Hi

This would be only for a selected few questions right because say for the credit card question, where the LLM is involved, to get the card number itself, we have to give a fine-tuned and strong query.

I have done the a1 to a10 task and tried querying through localhost and its working fine basically all these ten steps but dont know whether its enough or not. also steps in phase B i am confused that should we create separate endpoints for these tasks or should it be with same /run endpoint and query. then will the input be random by any user. what about the output . where should it be given. phase b needs more explanation.

Hi @carlton @Jivraj

Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A - A3 task.

I am able to read my files through the GET/read/data/dates.txt query.

I am also able to use the count_wednesdays function through the POST/run task/count_wednesdays.

But when I am entering a query such as “count_wednesdays in data/dates.txt” I am unable to get a response.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a snippet of a user interface (UI) that likely displays the response from an API call. It's structured in a table-like format with two columns: "Code" and "Details." Under "Details," there's a section labeled "Response body." The response body is presented as a JSON object within a dark gray box.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Headers:** "Code", "Details"
*   **Code Value:** "200"
*   **Details Label:** "Response body"
*   **JSON Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Could not understand the task"
    }
    ```

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image likely shows the result of an API request. A "200" status code generally indicates a successful request. However, the "error" message in the response body suggests that while the request itself was successful (in terms of reaching the server), the server was unable to process the task due to a problem with the input or the task itself.

**4. Technical details (JSON):**

The JSON response is a simple object with one key-value pair:

*   **Key:** "error"
*   **Value:** "Could not understand the task"

This indicates that the server encountered an issue understanding the task it was asked to perform. This could be due to incorrect formatting, missing information, or an unsupported request.

Please advice. Thank you.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows text instructions, likely from a task or assignment. The instructions involve processing data and using a Large Language Model (LLM).

**2. Any text content visible:**

The text content includes the following instructions:

*   "the sender's email address, and write just the email address to /data/email-sender.txt"
*   "A8. /data/credit-card.png contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to /data/credit-card.txt"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The context appears to be a data processing or information extraction task. The instructions outline how to extract specific information (email address and credit card number) from different data sources (text and image) and save the extracted information to specified files. The use of an LLM suggests a task involving natural language processing and potentially image analysis.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The instructions refer to specific file paths: `/data/email-sender.txt` and `/data/credit-card.txt`. These are likely the destination files where the extracted information should be saved.
*   The instruction mentions `/data/credit-card.png`, indicating that this is an image file containing a credit card number.
*   The task requires using an LLM to extract the credit card number from the image.
*   The extracted credit card number should be written to `/data/credit-card.txt` without any spaces.

On task A8, credit-card.png is given, but it is in credit_card.

it makes the errors. I checked that 2 to 3 tasks depend on these, and we create the ouput file with ‘-’ this only. please clarify that output and input files name ‘-’ or ‘_’   @carlton  @Jivraj

Hi Andrew,

You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.

I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.

**In other words getting 10/10 in `evaluate.py` does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation.**

So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of `evaluate.py`. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general *idea* of the task.

That said, `evaluate.py` is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).

Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)

**A word of caution:** *(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)* Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (*possibly your first task*) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

Kind regards

Respected @s.anand @carlton and @Jivraj ,

Is anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page? I have been raising this issue for the past few days, but there has been no response. Does this mean the TAs are not addressing students’ concerns?

I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints:

**[https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions](https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions)**
**[https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings)**

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a snippet of text, likely from a console or log output. The text appears to be a JSON-like structure representing an error message.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The text content is as follows:

```
{'error': 'API Error: 429, {\n "message": "On 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2"\n}'}
```

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The displayed text represents an error response from an API. The error indicates that a usage limit has been exceeded. Specifically, the error message states that on February 2025, a value of $2.002295600000011 was used, exceeding a limit of $2. The "429" error code typically signifies "Too Many Requests" or a rate limit being exceeded.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

The text is formatted in a way that resembles a JSON object, although it's not perfectly valid JSON due to the use of single quotes instead of double quotes for keys and strings. The `\n` sequences suggest newline characters, indicating that the message is intended to be formatted across multiple lines. The error code "429" is a standard HTTP status code for rate limiting.

This issue is blocking my progress, and I urgently need assistance to resolve it. Kindly provide guidance or suggest a solution at the earliest.

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks,

Telvin Varghese

Hi,

I am not able to understand how to do the Project 1. The date is also very near.

The problem I am facing is, When I did the Modules the page was different, but now in the Project 1 I am not getting any section to submit the project.

Please let me know where are the questions and how tot submit that.

The deadline is near.

carlton:

o do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of `evaluate.py`. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general *idea* of the task.

This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before

Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.

I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.

keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

Any tentative size cutoff for the docker image?

Hi Telvin

You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a webpage, likely a documentation or tutorial page, about using Large Language Models (LLMs). It appears to be part of a larger "Tools in Data Science" resource. The page includes text, instructions, and UI elements typical of a documentation site. A sidebar on the left provides navigation to other topics.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Title:** "Large Language Models"
*   **Introductory Text:** "This module covers the practical usage of large language models (LLMs) – a relatively a new area."
*   **Cost Information:** "LLMs incur a cost. We have created API keys for everyone with an iitm.ac.in email to use gpt-4o-mini and text-embedding-3-small. Your usage is limited to $1 per calendar month for this course. Don't exceed that."
*   **Instructions:** "Use AI Proxy instead of OpenAI. Specifically:"
    *   "1. Replace your API to `https://api.openai.com/...` with `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...`"
    *   "2. Replace the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` that someone will give you."
*   **Navigation:**
    *   "Previous: Local LLMs: Llamafile"
    *   "Next: Prompt engineering"
*   **Sidebar Navigation:**
    *   "Tools in Data Science"
    *   "Development Tools"
    *   "Deployment Tools"
    *   "Large Language Models"
    *   "Prompt engineering"
    *   "TDS TA Instructions"
    *   "TDS GPT Reviewer"
    *   "LLM Sentiment Analysis"
    *   "LLM Text Extraction"
    *   "Base 64 Encoding"
    *   "Vision Models"
    *   "Embeddings"
    *   "Topic modeling"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The page provides instructions on how to use LLMs, specifically within a course or environment where API keys are provided to users with an "iitm.ac.in"

In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50

As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ *(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)* for us!

The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.

In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.

Kind regards

Thanks for your response, @Carlton. It seems I won’t be able to proceed with the project until this issue is resolved. Also, I haven’t used LLM so much until February 7th to cost $2.

Every request you send, gives you a response back with exactly how much that request cost. So you can track your usage.

I’m aware of that. I’ve mostly noticed a cost of $0.0003 per request, so I haven’t been tracking my total monthly expenses. Moving forward, I’ll keep a record of the cost for each request. Also, do strong prompts impact the overall cost?

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-11 181453**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal output, likely from a Linux or Unix-like operating system. It displays a command being executed and the resulting error message.

**2. Text Content:**

The text content can be broken down as follows:

*   **Command Prompt:** `abhro014@Abhro:/mnt/d/My_folder/IITM online degree/Diploma/TDS/Project1$`
    *   This indicates the user `abhro014` is logged in on a machine named `Abhro`.
    *   The current working directory is `/mnt/d/My_folder/IITM online degree/Diploma/TDS/Project1`. This suggests the user is working on a project related to an IITM online degree/diploma.
*   **Command Executed:** `uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py 23f1002104@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
    *   The command `uv run` is being used to execute a Python script.
    *   The script is located at a remote URL on GitHub: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py`. This suggests the script is part of a public repository related to a "tools-in-data-science" course or project.
    *   `23f1002104@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is likely an argument passed to the script, possibly an email address or user ID.
*   **Output:**
    *   `Reading inline script metadata from remote URL` - This indicates the `uv` command is processing the script from the URL.
    *   `Traceback (most recent call last):` - This signals that an error occurred during the script execution.
    *   `File "/tmp/datagen2eQ208.py", line 284, in 

Could you kindly help me with this

NEED HELP. CAN SOMEONE CONTACT OLLAMA AND ASK THEM TO CHECK THEIR CODE ITS HAS SOME SILLY MISTAKES IN CODE EXAMPLES. I DONT KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

[LINK TO PAGE WITH CODE EXAMPLE](https://ollama.com/blog/embedding-models)

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-11 232608**
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows two code snippets, likely from a tutorial or documentation, demonstrating how to store and retrieve documents using vector embeddings. The code appears to be written in Python. The snippets are presented within a structured format, with headings and explanatory text.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **First Snippet:**
    *   `# store each document in a vector embedding database`
    *   `for i, d in enumerate(documents):`
    *   `response = ollama.embed(model="mxbai-embed-large", input=d)`
    *   `embeddings = response["embeddings"]`
    *   `collection.add(`
    *   `ids=[str(i)],`
    *   `embeddings=embeddings,`
    *   `documents=[d]`
    *   `)`
*   **Heading:** `Step 2: Retrieve`
*   `Next, add the code to retrieve the most relevant document given an example prompt:`
*   **Second Snippet:**
    *   `# an example input`
    *   `input = "What animals are llamas related to?"`
    *   `# generate an embedding for the input and retrieve the most relevant doc`
    *   `response = ollama.embed(`
    *   `model="mxbai-embed-large",`
    *   `input=prompt`
    *   `)`
    *   `results = collection.query(`
    *   `query_embeddings=[response["embedding"]],`
    *   `n_results=1`
    *   `)`
    *   `data = results['documents'][0][0]`

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image illustrates a two-step process:

*   **Step 1 (Implied):**  Storing documents in a vector embedding database. The first code snippet shows how to iterate through a list of documents, generate embeddings for each using `ollama.embed` with the "mxbai-embed-large" model, and add them to a collection. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and the document itself.
*   **Step 2 (Explicit):**

correct code in step 2 collection query step

response = ollama.embed(
  model="nomic-embed-text:latest",
  input=task
)
results = collection.query(
  query_embeddings=response["embeddings"], #here embeddings and also not list of list as response embeddings already gives correct format
  n_results=1
)
data = results['documents'][0][0]

As in the previous session for task a1 we use llm just to get the url and email , so after retriving the both arguments can i use them in a function and got the work given in work done in function.

Also, am i correct that we use llm only to retrive url or location ??

Has anyone succeeded in the extraction of credit cards details task? The LLM seems to consider it as illegal task and if I use pytessaract the docker image size will become really large. What to do in this case?

Hi @carlton @Jivraj,

I followed what you taught in Feb 11 session and tried implementing task A1. My understanding is once i run the subprocess, datagen.py file should be run and /data folder should be created in the project folder. But it is not happening to me. I am getting the following error

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/folders/rj/z_3b8hl51558519w90k5hp600000gn/T/datagen4COEF3.py", line 284, in <module>
    os.makedirs(config["root"], exist_ok=True)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "<frozen os>", line 227, in makedirs
OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/data'

If i can’t automate this process, i don’t see the point writing code for other tasks. Can anyone help me solving this error?

If I am not wrong, both the expected and actual result contain the same entries. It is just that the ordering is different. The expected result also doesnt follow any particular format (so does the actual result).

Kindly advise on this @carlton

**EDIT** : Resolved on a later evaluation

For the task - * **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

Do we have to handle prompts for converting CSV to JSON or for writing an endpoint for doing so?

Dear Instructors (@carlton, @iamprasna):

Confirming, just to be needfully pedantic:

It will **solely** be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator (human or machine) to parse the correct `AIPROXY_TOKEN` generated against my IITM email ID (presumably, per some database which holds all such generated `AIPROXY_TOKEN`s of the students who have generated one); and the correct `$IMAGE_NAME` (to-be-submitted by myself in the Project Submission Google Form) in `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`, correct?

Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository, or the dockerfile.

I am also facing the same issue, just that the ordering is different.

Please help on this @carlton @Jivraj

sir will the tasks of Phase A and Phase B change? like currently do we need to make llm write the code for all tasks dynamically or can we write a pre defined python code to execute tasks after the llm parses the task and runs python code

That error is usually if you are using the wrong endpoint (ie. using open ai libraries instead of sending requests to aiproxy).

Without seeing the request its hard to tell you what the cause of the error is.

Kind regards

you mean screenshot of evaluate.py file?

**Image: Screenshot from 2025-02-12 20-21-56**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a code snippet from a Python file, likely within a code editor or IDE. The code is formatted with syntax highlighting. The bottom of the image shows tabs for "PROBLEMS", "OUTPUT", "DEBUG CONSOLE", "TERMINAL", and "PORTS".

**2. Any text content visible:**

The code snippet contains the following text:

*   `return email in await read("/data/format.md")`
*   `async def a2(email: str, file: str = "/data/format.md", **kwargs):`
*   `original = get_markdown(email)`
*   `expected = subprocess.run(`
*   `["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--stdin-filepath", file],`
*   `input=original,`
*   `capture_output=True,`
*   `text=True,`
*   `# check=True,`
*   `# Ensure npx is picked up from the PATH on Windows`
*   `shell=True,`
*   `).stdout`
*   `result = await run(`
*   `f"""`
*   `Format the contents of `{file}` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place`
*   `"""`
*   `)`
*   `result = await read(file)`
*   `if result != expected:`
*   `return mismatch(file, expected, result)`
*   `return True`
*   `async def a3(email, **kwargs):`
*   `dates = get_dates(email)`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The code appears to be part of a testing or formatting script. The function `a2` seems to be formatting a markdown file using `prettier` via `npx`. It reads the original content, runs `prettier` on it, and then compares the formatted output with the expected output. If there's a mismatch, it calls a `mismatch` function. The function `a3` is also defined, and it calls `get_dates(email)`.

**4. Technical details if it'

@carlton @Jivraj

could you please help me out on how to start with TDS Project-1, as I am stuck at the moment and don’t know where to start from. This project is very much unfamiliar for me and I need some guidance on how to start with it. It would be really great if you could provide some help through resources/materials/videos and help me complete the project. Thanks in advance!

My final docker image size is coming 1.25 gb, I am using the ubuntu base image as I thought it would be appropriate given the tasks. Is it ok with that size?

PS - Also I would be running out of token if I need to test again with some other base image now.

You do not need the whole of ubuntu!

Just python and uv

More like 128mb image.

Please watch Tues week 5 session 1

I could pull it down to 610 mb, using python:3.9-slim now, but there are some essential libraries that is needed which is taking up the space…will it be ok? I mean installing on the go with uv might lead to timeout during evaluation…

Sir in main.py file I’m defining task with different variables . But in evaluate.py tasks are defined by different variables to test and when I’m testing it using python evaluate.py it returns unsuccessful . I’m testing all my tasks of main.py with Postman it returns successful.

My query is that how the tasks get evaluated and do i need to change my variables in main.py ? And what are the other things i have to change.

Also plss update evaluate.py fie with phase B tasks

Hi instructors and TAs,

For the different tasks in Phase B, I don’t have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect.

eg.

Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query’s response on an output file like A10? or as a response?

I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require.

Thanks,

Trebhuvan

Output specifications will be detailed in the “task” sent to the endpoint.

Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve *all tasks using the same function* !

@carlton @Jivraj

will it be ok? Actually I developed it in a way that require some of the essential dependencies and at this point of time it would be dangerous to alter the way of handling it as I am running short of AIProxy Token credits.

Earlier when I asked this:

 21f2000709:

Any tentative size cutoff for the docker image?

I could have altered my way of handling dependencies but at that point of time there was no clear numbers.

I request you to please allow this time around with this size…

Hi @Rishabh2

What exactly you mean by variables?  only one argument is required for running `evaluate.py` that’s an email address.

You need to download both `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` in same folder and then execute `evaluate.py` using uv.

`uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email`.

For phase B

    [Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/183) Tools in Data Science

Hi @23f1002382

This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.

The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks.

What you can do is, **try to fool it using itself.** Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.

Try creating a better prompt for this task.

*Hint: Ask it to recheck certain similar looking digits.*

After submitting docker image through, it will be pulled and our token will be used.

Things to be checked at your end.

1.` podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` works fine

2.  Above command will start 8000 server so use evaluate.py to test if things are working as expected.

Kind regards.

I think there was something wrong with the way the code was getting inputs (keys). I just rewrote that part and it worked

Command to run the image in the docs, seemed to have some error,

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-13 at 1.31.01 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a snippet of text, likely from a documentation page or tutorial. It includes a command-line instruction and a URL. The text is displayed against a dark gray background, suggesting it might be from a code editor, terminal, or documentation platform with a dark theme.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   "Ensure that running your image via"
*   "podman run $IMAGE\_NAME -e AIPROXY\_TOKEN=$AIPROXY\_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 automatically"
*   "serves the API at http://localhost:8000/run?task=... and"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The text provides instructions on how to run a Docker image using `podman`. The command sets an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` and maps port 8000. The subsequent text indicates that running the image will automatically serve an API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...`. This suggests the image contains an API server that can be accessed locally.

**4. Technical details (code screenshot):**

*   **`podman run`**: This is a command to run a container using Podman, a container engine.
*   **`$IMAGE_NAME`**: This is a placeholder for the name of the Docker image to be run.
*   **`-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`**: This sets an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` inside the container. The value is taken from the host environment.
*   **`-p 8000:8000`**: This maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container. This allows access to the container's services from the host.
*   **`http://localhost:8000/run?task=...`**: This is a URL indicating the endpoint of the API served by the container. The `?task=...` part suggests that the API takes a `task` parameter.

The command:

`podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`

gives the error:

`crun: executable file `-e` not found in $PATH: No such file or directory: OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not found`

However the correct command seems to be:

`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN" -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

This works totally fine.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-13 at 1.33.21 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal window with a dark background. It displays the output of a command-line execution, including the command itself and subsequent informational messages.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Command:** `pradeepmondal.iitm@Pradeeps-MacBook-Air llm-based-automation-agent % podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN" -p 8000:8000 tds-project-pradeep-mondal`
*   **Informational Messages:**
    *   `INFO: Started server process [1]`
    *   `INFO: Waiting for application startup.`
    *   `INFO: Application startup complete.`
    *   `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows the startup process of a Uvicorn server within a Podman container. The command executed uses Podman to run a container named `tds-project-pradeep-mondal`. The `-e` flag sets an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` using the value of the `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable. The `-p` flag maps port 8000 of the container to port 8000 on the host machine. The informational messages indicate that a server process has started, the application is starting up, and the application startup is complete. Finally, Uvicorn, an ASGI server, is running and listening on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. The user is instructed to press `CTRL+C` to quit the server.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **Podman:** Podman is a container engine similar to Docker, used for running and managing containers.
*   **Uvicorn:** Uvicorn is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server, commonly used for running asynchronous Python web applications.
*   **Environment Variable:** The `-e` flag in the `podman run` command sets an environment variable within the container. In this case, `AIPROXY_

One final question @Jivraj @carlton , will our projects be evaluated with our `AIPROXY_TOKEN` or a different one.

Because my project is done but for evaluation if my `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is used, it might be out of credits.

@Jivraj sir I get this error

but my app.py is able to get the server running on localhost and not on 0.0.0.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal window with a dark background. It displays a command-line interface (CLI) session, including commands entered by the user and the resulting output, which includes an error traceback.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The following text is visible in the image:

*   `vikramjncasr@ANJANEYA:/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project$ podman run 20511982f949`
*   `Traceback (most recent call last):`
*   `File "/app/app.py", line 1, in `
*   `import fastapi`
*   `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`
*   `vikramjncasr@ANJANEYA:/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project$`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows an error that occurred while running a container using `podman`. The user, `vikramjncasr`, is in the directory `/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project` and attempts to run a container identified by the ID `20511982f949`. The container execution fails because the Python script `/app/app.py` attempts to import the `fastapi` module, but this module is not found within the container's environment. This indicates that the `fastapi` library is either not installed within the container or not accessible to the Python interpreter running inside the container.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

*   **Command:** `podman run 20511982f949` - This command attempts to run a container using Podman, a container management tool similar to Docker. The argument `20511982f949` is likely the ID or name of the container image.
*   **Traceback:** The traceback indicates a Python error. It shows the sequence of function calls that led to the error.
*   **File "/app/app.py", line 1, in :** This line indicates that

could you please help ?

Install datagen.py in the same folder from where you are executing evaluate.py.

@vikramjncasr Check how you are executing, use uv or else install required modules globally

Sir would the belowformat be ok when you evaluate ?

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal or console output, likely from a development environment. It displays information messages related to starting and running a Uvicorn server. The prompt indicates the current directory is `C:\IIT_Madras\TDS_Project`.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The text content includes:

*   `INFO:` (repeatedly, indicating informational messages)
*   `Finished server process [30576]`
*   `PS C:\IIT_Madras\TDS_Project> uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000` (This is the command that was executed)
*   `Started server process [5584]`
*   `Waiting for application startup.`
*   `Application startup complete.`
*   `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`
*   `127.0.0.1:54184 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
*   `[]` (likely the start of a new prompt line)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The output shows the process of starting a Uvicorn web server. Uvicorn is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server, commonly used for running Python web applications built with frameworks like FastAPI or Starlette.

The command `uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000` starts the server. `app:app` specifies the module and object (likely a FastAPI or Starlette application instance) to be served. `--host 127.0.0.1` sets the server to listen on the local loopback address, and `--port 8000` sets the port to 8000.

The subsequent messages indicate that the server started successfully and is running. The line `127.0.0.1:54184 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 OK` shows a client (likely a web browser) made

@Jivraj  @carlton sir can you take my doubt in today’s session please , i have successfully run docker server but endpoints are not working…

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-13 165912**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a development environment, likely a code editor (Visual Studio Code) alongside a web browser. The code editor displays a Python file, and the browser shows the output of a web application. There's also a terminal window showing Git commands.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Browser:**
    *   URL: `http://localhost:5000`
    *   Content: `{"detail":"Not Found"}`
*   **Code Editor (app.py):**

I am also facing the same issue.

Evaluation Output:

HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"

🔴 A9 failed: 'data'

❌ A9 FAILED

I sense ‘Authentication Problem’ happens only with the evaluation script, as the curl requests seems to work fine.

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

@Jivraj @carlton Sir i keep getting this error

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal window displaying the output of a Python program execution. It includes a command prompt, a traceback error message, and details about the error.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **(tds-project-1) vidushilinux@swastivivo:~/tds-project-1$ uv run app.py** - This is the command prompt. It indicates the user `vidushilinux` is working on a machine named `swastivivo` in the directory `~/tds-project-1`. The command `uv run app.py` is being executed, which likely means running the Python script `app.py` using a tool called `uv`.
*   **Traceback (most recent call last):** - This indicates the start of a Python traceback, which is a report of the call stack at the point where an error occurred.
*   **File "/home/vidushilinux/tds-project-1/app.py", line 9, in ** - This line specifies the file and line number where the error occurred. It's in the file `app.py` located in the directory `/home/vidushilinux/tds-project-1/`, specifically on line 9, within the top-level module scope (``).
*   **from fastapi import FastAPI** - This is the line of code that caused the error. It's an import statement trying to import the `FastAPI` class from the `fastapi` module.
*   **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'** - This is the error message. It indicates that the Python interpreter could not find a module named `fastapi`.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows a common error in Python development: a missing dependency. The program `app.py` requires the `fastapi` library, but it's not installed in the current environment. The user is trying to run a Python application that uses the FastAPI framework, but the framework is not available.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

*   The error is a `ModuleNotFoundError`, which is a standard Python exception raised when

even though i have downloaded the packages globally and tried installing them by making a venv but nothing seems to work please help

@Jivraj @carlton sir please help

When I am downloading the data folder after processing datagen.py , it is trying to download in root folder and it is facing permission error . how can we overcome this ?

needs sudo permission all the time…

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal window, likely running on a Linux or Unix-like operating system. It displays command-line interactions.

**2. Text Content:**

The terminal displays the following text:

*   `vikramjncasr@ANJANEYA:/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1$` (This is the command prompt, indicating the user `vikramjncasr` is logged in on a machine named `ANJANEYA`, and the current working directory is `/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1`)
*   `sudo rm -rf /data` (This command is partially visible at the top of the image)
*   `ls /` (This is a command to list the contents of the root directory `/`)
*   The output of the `ls /` command, which lists the following directories:
    *   `bin`
    *   `boot`
    *   `dev`
    *   `etc`
    *   `home`
    *   `init`
    *   `lib`
    *   `lib64`
    *   `lib.usr-is-merged`
    *   `lost+found`
    *   `media`
    *   `mnt`
    *   `opt`
    *   `proc`
    *   `root`
    *   `run`
    *   `sbin`
    *   `sbin.usr-is-merged`
    *   `snap`
    *   `srv`
    *   `sys`
    *   `tmp` (Highlighted in green)
    *   `usr`
    *   `var`

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The image shows a user navigating the file system using the command line. The user is in a specific directory (`/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1`) and has listed the contents of the root directory (`/`). The `sudo rm -rf /data` command suggests the user was attempting to delete a directory named `data` with root privileges.

Hello Sir @carlton @Jivraj

What are implications on missing the project 1.

Due to some personal reasons I wasn’t able to start any work on my project 1. It seems difficult for me to complete it.

Could you please tell what will be the implications of missing it. Will I in anyway be able to cover up and pass in the subject doing future assignments and projects?

Thank you

PS: This isn’t any request to extend dates. I accept my fault and respect the dates provided by the team.

Sir I haven’t initaiated the podman earlier.

Now when i try to use podman using the wsl via the code “sudo apt install -y podman” it is asking for the password…

The problem is:

I haven’t set any password for podman earlier.
Though it is asking for password but it is not taking any input.(ie I am unable type anything there).

what should I am supposed to do…

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) window. The active tab is the "TERMINAL" tab. The terminal is running a shell, likely within a Linux environment (WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux). On the right side of the VS Code window, there's a panel showing available terminal profiles: "powershell" and "wsl".

**2. Any text content visible:**

The terminal output shows a series of commands being executed with `sudo` (superuser do). The user "ayushcodes2611" is attempting to execute commands that require administrative privileges.

Here's a breakdown of the commands and output:

*   `[sudo] password for ayushcodes2611:` - This indicates the system is prompting for the user's password to grant sudo privileges.
*   `Sorry, try again.` - The password entered was incorrect.
*   `sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts` - The user has entered the wrong password three times.
*   `sudo: a password is required` - The system is still prompting for the password.
*   `ayushcodes2611@DESKTOP-Q9B00U6:/mnt/d/TDS/Project$ sudo apt update` - The user is attempting to update the package lists using `apt update`.
*   `ayushcodes2611@DESKTOP-Q9B00U6:/mnt/d/TDS/Project$ sudo passwd` - The user is attempting to change their password using `sudo passwd`.
*   `ayushcodes2611@DESKTOP-Q9B00U6:/mnt/d/TDS/Project$ sudo apt install -y podman` - The user is attempting to install the `podman` package using `apt install`. The `-y` flag automatically confirms the installation.

The current working directory in the terminal is `/mnt/d/TDS/Project`. The username is `ayushcodes2611` and the hostname is `DESKTOP-Q9B00U6`.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The user is likely trying to perform administrative tasks within

@s.anand @Jivraj I think the evaluation.py test case is broken for A8 because I can manually see more folders and markdown files than the expected case output of A8 evaluation. And also is there any evaluation file for Part B

A silly Doubt though but still a doubt!

Could we create an image first of our project in initial stage(ie the my “app.py” is not completely ready) but I have build an docker image including the app.py and other dependencies.

Should I give the same url now and then carry on updating the app.py

Or, Should first complete and then upload in the form!

plz reply!!

Hi @Jivraj, @carlton, @Saransh_Saini sir,

I’m getting the following error while post mapping, I couldn’t able to fix it.

I’m getting status code as 400 from the llm api response. How to fix it sir?

   "json": {
        "message": "Invalid JSON body: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'm', \"model=gpt-\"... is not valid JSON"
    }

There is some problem with the json that you are using.

Try to debug it with GPT.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with an error message overlay. The error message indicates that the VS Code window is not responding. The bottom of the VS Code window shows the "TERMINAL" tab and the "powershell" terminal.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Code Editor:**
    *   `led`
    *   `10 == 0`
    *   `EN": os.environ.get("AIPROXY`
*   **Error Message Box:**
    *   "Visual Studio Code" (title bar)
    *   "The window is not responding" (main message)
    *   "You can reopen or close the window or keep waiting." (explanatory text)
    *   "Don't restore editors" (checkbox label)
    *   "Reopen" (button)
    *   "Close" (button)
    *   "Keep Waiting" (button)
*   **VS Code Interface:**
    *   "TERMINAL" (tab label)
    *   "powershell" (terminal indicator)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image captures a situation where VS Code has become unresponsive. The error message box is a standard operating system dialog that appears when an application stops responding to user input. The user is given options to either reopen the application (potentially losing unsaved work), close the application, or wait in the hope that it will eventually recover. The code visible in the editor suggests the user was working with Python code, possibly related to environment variables.

**4. Technical details (code screenshot):**

*   The code snippet `os.environ.get("AIPROXY` suggests the user is trying to access an environment variable named "AIPROXY" using Python's `os` module.
*   The code `10 == 0` is a simple comparison that always evaluates to `False`. It's unclear what the purpose of this line is without more context.
*   The code editor appears to be using a dark theme.
*   The terminal is running PowerShell.

Is someone else are also getting this kind of error messages…

I have a low end system, then shifted to high one then again this popped up…

Does anyone know how to come over this…

Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini sir, I have implemented the code for B3 & B6 but unfortunately as per the instructions given in project for B3 & B6 —

**B6**. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website

**B3**. Fetch data from an API and save it

They are almost similar and it’s getting confusing in both cases, it’s given output based on B3 and not reading the input for B6, so could you please help me out with this?

Is anyone else facing this or a similar issue?

Two solutions

give proper permissions.
use docker containers this is what we will test on.

I would prefer 2nd approach

For B tasks use LLM to write code on the fly and execute it, use better prompts. In evaluation script detailed task will be provided with what data needs to be scraped, endpoints, parameters, etc.

local llm also we cant use you because you have some limit on file size, we send long prompt also it doesn’t work xD . What do we do?

Hi,

If you read these questions carefully then they are not similar, one is asking you to extract data from a webpage, meaning you have to do something related to the HTML code. And the other is simply sending a request to a given endpoint.

Hi @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj ,

In task A6

**Find all Markdown (`.md` ) files in `/data/docs/` . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `# ` ). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}` ).**

Here expected output JSON “key” is file name or file path without prefix /data/docs/ as prompt is bit confusing . when “path/to/large-language-models.md” is given in example is actually referring to file path or filename itself is “path/to/large-language-models.md”.

This can easily be checked by runing the evaluate.py file.

Anyways, a file present in data/docs/folder_a/folder_b/md_file should be folder_a/folder_b/md_file as key.

Sir, my token limit has crossed the $1 limit. Will I receive new limit or a fresh token ? I still need to complete my project.

Thank you

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-14 183844**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **UI Elements:**
    *   The image shows a webpage, specifically the pricing page for the OpenAI API.
    *   There are two main sections displaying pricing information for two different models: "GPT-4o" and "GPT-4o mini".
    *   A browser address bar is visible at the top, showing the URL "openai.com/api/pricing/".
    *   In the top right corner, there's a "Log in" button and a user profile icon.
    *   At the bottom, there's a "Ask ChatGPT" button.

2.  **Text Content:**
    *   **GPT-4o:**
        *   "High-intelligence model for complex tasks | 128k context length"
        *   "Price"
        *   "Input: $2.50 / 1M tokens"
        *   "Cached input: $1.25 / 1M tokens"
        *   "Output: $10.00 / 1M tokens"
    *   **GPT-4o mini:**
        *   "Affordable small model for fast, everyday tasks | 128k context length"
        *   "Price"
        *   "Input: $0.150 / 1M tokens"
        *   "Cached input: $0.075 / 1M tokens"
        *   "Output: $0.600 / 1M tokens"

3.  **Context/Purpose:**
    *   The image displays the pricing structure for two different OpenAI models, GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini.
    *   It provides a comparison of the costs associated with using each model, broken down by input, cached input, and output tokens.
    *   The descriptions highlight the intended use cases for each model (complex tasks vs. everyday tasks) and their context length capabilities.

4.  **Technical Details:**
    *   The pricing is based on the number of tokens processed (1M tokens).
    *   There's a distinction between "Input", "Cached input", and "Output", suggesting different pricing for the data sent to the model, data retrieved from cache, and the data generated

You can continue to $2. Then you would need to ask for a new token.

For as task description like this

Write the # of Thursdays in `/data/extracts.txt` into `/data/extracts-count.txt`

I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to understand the task because of the “#” symbol. The task is getting truncated even before it reaches to the LLM.

Can anyone help me on this because I have tried so many things to fix this but nothing seems to help.

@carlton @Jivraj

sir i have tried to solve the A1. when I want to check the solution we are asked for the datagen module as the evaluate.py have

’

''from datagen import (
    get_markdown,
    get_dates,
    get_contacts,
    get_logs,
    get_docs,
    get_email,
    get_credit_card,
    get_comments,
    get_tickets,
)
'''

so do we need to download the datagen.py in the local system first…

Or it should be the part of the automation only…

Yes I know that but LLM does not know that # indicates number. And no prompt is fixing this issue because the task has to be passed as query parameter and by the time LLM reads the task, it is already half gone due to #.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. UI Elements:**

*   The image shows a code editor interface, likely VS Code or a similar IDE.
*   There are tabs at the top, with "main.py >" being the active tab, indicating a Python file is open.
*   Below the code editor, there's a panel with tabs: "PROBLEMS," "OUTPUT," "DEBUG CONSOLE," "TERMINAL," and "PORTS." The "TERMINAL" tab is currently selected.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Python Code:**
    *   A function definition: `def handle_task_A2(file_path: str, prettier_version: str):`
    *   An `if` statement: `if file_path and os.path.exists(file_path):`
    *   A `print` statement: `print('Path exisit - will perform prettier')`
    *   A `subprocess.run` call: `subprocess.run(["npx", f"prettier@{prettier_version}", "--write", file_path])`
    *   An `else` block: `else:`
    *   A `raise` statement: `raise FileNotFoundError()`
*   **Terminal Output:**
    *   `/data/format.md` (likely a file path)
    *   `AEXPECTED:`
    *   `#Unformatted Markdown`
    *   `This is a sample paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace.`
    *   `- First item`
    *   `- Second item`
    *   `+Third item`
    *   `* Fourth item`
    *   `py`
    *   `print("user@example.com")`
    *   `ARESULT:`
    *   `#Unformatted Markdown`
    *   `This is a sample paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace.`
    *   `- First item`
    *   `- Second item`
    *   `+Third item`
    *   `* Fourth item`
    *   `py`

**3. Context and Purpose:**

*   The Python code defines a function `handle_task_A2` that takes a file path and a Prettier version as input.
*

Okay, actually when i tried with local, i’m facing path error

./data/format.md
[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified

So that’s why i moved to docker but there also i’m getting error for A2.

you should manually check if the file really exists or not because i think the code and the folder where datagen.py is downloading files(data folder) are different

If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‘#’ and change it to ‘number’ and then send the prompt to the llm for that particular task.

Or another approach is tell the llm,

If you ever see the phrase ‘count the # of’ in a task, please interpret it as ‘count the number of’. For example

Count the # of Fridays means

Count the number of Fridays

Please read the deliverables and evalute section.

datagen.py and evaluate.py were for only for your testing purposes so that you have an idea of the workflow and how the evaluation works. They are NOT part of your project submission.

Only DO what the project page tells you in the deliverables and evalute sections.

sir i am getting this error by running the docker image

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a Python traceback error message. This is a common output when a Python program encounters an exception during execution.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The text content includes:

*   "Traceback (most recent call last):" - This indicates the start of the traceback.
*   "File "/app/app.py", line 11, in " - This line specifies the file where the error occurred ("/app/app.py"), the line number (11), and that the error happened in the top-level module.
*   "from fastapi import FastAPI" - This is the line of code that caused the error. It's an attempt to import the `FastAPI` class from the `fastapi` module.
*   "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'" - This is the specific error message, indicating that the Python interpreter could not find a module named "fastapi".

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows an error that occurs when a Python program tries to import the `fastapi` library, but the library is not installed or not accessible in the current environment. This is a common issue when working with Python projects that have external dependencies.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

The traceback indicates that the error occurred during the import statement. The `ModuleNotFoundError` is a standard Python exception raised when an import fails because the module cannot be found. The file path "/app/app.py" suggests that this code is likely part of a larger application deployed in a containerized environment (like Docker). The error implies that the `fastapi` package needs to be installed, typically using `pip install fastapi`.

Hey @carlton @Jivraj , I actually submitted the project already in the morning,

I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation section.

But since I was actively testing with the - `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py`, I forgot to remove them before submission.

However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way, they just sit idle. Will there be any issue?

These files are inside a separate folder - `evaluation` in my project root directory. Since I already submitted please do consider.

Thanks & Regards

This indicates your task execution returns  “HTTP/1.1 200 OK” but the execution doesn’t creates the required file in the given location that the evaluation script is requesting.

22f3001011 I’ve enabled “Allow response editing” on the form. I *think* that means you can edit your response… but since you had submitted it before it was enabled, I’m not sure what the procedure is. Worst case, please submit again.

In evaluation script url of datagen.py is different than actual one please change it

Install `uv` (if required) and run the script `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py`

very true there is too much confusion Id like to ask if you know that evaluate.py is mean to run only for [user@example.com](mailto:user@example.com) or our own mail too  because there was written **You MUST use your Student Id** (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) **to do the Project, otherwise your score will not be considered for evaluation.**

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows the interface of a code editor, likely Visual Studio Code (VS Code), with a Dockerfile open in the editor pane and a terminal window at the bottom.

The terminal window displays the output of a command.

i too got the same error you can change the the tools part in your payload to

"tools": [{"type": "function", "function": schema} for schema in function_schema]

i think you have to run the following command

uv run datagen.py <your_email> --root ./data

try to include --root ./data in your code

@carlton  @Jivraj

Hello,

just a silly question, if my code runs well in docker environment with `/data` in root directory, will it be fine ?

or should i keep the relative `./data` directory like in the lecture ?

Thanks

The reason in the lecture they were using ./data was because they were debugging in their local machine not in the docker.

For the docker image (the official submission) you must use /data.

It is a clear requirement mentioned in the project page.

Thats why it works fine when you use it in the docker image.

Kind regards

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-15 101818**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a portion of a web form, likely a survey or assignment submission form. It contains two questions related to code repositories and DockerHub images. Each question has a text input field for the user to provide an answer. The second question also displays an error message.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Question 1:** "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1? *"
    *   "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name"
    *   **Answer:** "https://github.com/Atimanas-Biswal421/proj1"
*   **Question 2:** "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub? *"
    *   "It should look like user-name/image-name"
    *   **Answer:** "atimanasbiswal/proj1-tds:final"
    *   **Error Message:** "Must match pattern" (accompanied by a warning icon)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The form is designed to collect information about a user's project, specifically the location of the code on GitHub and the name of the DockerHub image associated with the project. The error message suggests that the user's input for the DockerHub image name does not conform to the expected format or a predefined pattern.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The first question asks for a GitHub repository link, which follows the standard URL structure: `https://github.com//`. The provided answer seems to adhere to this format.
*   The second question asks for a DockerHub image name, which is expected to be in the format `/`. The provided answer "atimanasbiswal/proj1-tds:final" includes a tag ":final" which might be causing the "Must match pattern" error. The pattern likely expects only the `/` format without a tag.

@Jivraj  @carlton

hello sir i need help here. I have pushed my image into a docker repo and trying to submit it on ht google form. but it is not accepting it and asking to remove the tag .

What do i do ?

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of a code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The editor appears to be displaying several files and their contents, along with a terminal output. The UI elements include:

*   **File Explorer/Project Navigator:** A panel on the left side lists files and directories.
*   **Editor Window:** The main area displays the content of the currently selected file.
*   **Tabs:** Tabs at the top indicate open files (taskA2.py, evaluate.py, datagen.py).
*   **Terminal Panel:** A panel at the bottom displays the output of commands or program execution.
*   **Menu Bar:** At the very top, there's a menu bar with options like "Selection," "View," "Go," "Run," "Terminal," and "Help."

**2. Text Content:**

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) displaying a server response, likely from an API call. The UI includes tabs for "Response," "Headers," "Cookies," "Results," and "Docs." The "Response" tab is currently selected, and it displays a JSON object.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Status:** 500 Internal Server Error
*   **Size:** 184 Bytes
*   **Time:** 792 ms
*   **Tabs:** Response, Headers, Cookies, Results, Docs
*   **JSON Content:**
    *   `{`
    *   `"detail": "Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}"`
    *   `}`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows an error response from a server. The "500 Internal Server Error" status indicates a problem on the server-side. The JSON response provides more detail, indicating an authentication error (Error code 401). Specifically, the error message states that the authentication token provided is not from a valid issuer. This suggests that the application is trying to use a token that was not issued by a trusted authority or that the token has been tampered with.

**4. Technical details (code screenshot):**

*   The code is in JSON format, a common data-interchange format.
*   The "detail" field contains a string that includes the error code and a nested JSON object with more specific error information.
*   The nested JSON object has fields like "message," "type," "param," and "code," which are standard ways to structure error information in APIs.
*   The error type is "invalid\_request\_error," and the specific code is "invalid\_issuer," further pinpointing the authentication issue.

why do i get this error? can someone please help me out @Jivraj @carlton…Anyone pls help

sir,

It is a humble requests from my side, to plz extend the deadline.

Because student like who come from non technical background, are unable to come up with this project…

though we have somehow comeup with the GAs taking the helps of groups, seniors and sessions.

Moreover I am Dual Degree student. It is very hectic for me.

Sir you won’t believe but I am continuously trying since last week. Specially after the release of the sessions… Whole day and night have gone like nothing, infront of the computer…

Plz sir understand the situation and extend the deadline…

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-15 140726**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data structure. JSON is a lightweight format for data-interchange.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The JSON object contains a single key-value pair:

*   **Key:** `"message"`
*   **Value:** `"On 2025-02 you used $2.0037491399999996, exceeding $2"`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The JSON object likely represents an error or warning message. The message indicates that on February 2025, a user exceeded a limit of $2, having used $2.0037491399999996. This could be related to a budget, spending limit, or some other constraint.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **JSON Format:** The data is structured according to JSON syntax, using curly braces `{}` to enclose the object, double quotes `""` for keys and string values, and a colon `:` to separate keys from their values.
*   **Data Types:** The key `"message"` is a string. The value associated with it is also a string.
*   **Floating-Point Precision:** The value `$2.0037491399999996` suggests a floating-point number. The long decimal portion indicates that the value might have been the result of a calculation or conversion that introduced some level of precision.

it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi)

then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it.

Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.

create a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv

add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location

and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.

It even happened for me

**Image: Screenshot_20250215_143357**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal window, likely running on an Arch Linux system. It displays the output of commands related to Python package installation using `pip3`.

**2. Text Content:**

The terminal output includes the following:

*   **Command:** `pip3 install numpy`
*   **Error Message:** `error: externally-managed-environment`
*   **Explanation of the Error:**
    *   "This environment is externally managed."
    *   Suggests using `pacman -S python-xyz` to install Python packages system-wide.
    *   Suggests creating a virtual environment using `python -m venv path/to/venv` for non-Arch-packaged Python packages.
    *   Suggests using `pipx install xyz` for non-Arch packaged Python applications.
*   **Note:** "If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing `--break-system-packages`."
*   **Hint:** "See PEP 668 for the detailed specification."
*   **Command:** `source /home/jaideep/.python3/bin/activate`
*   **Command:** `pip3 install numpy`
*   **Output:** `Requirement already satisfied: numpy in ./.python3/lib/python3.13/site-packages (2.2.2)`
*   **Shell Prompts:** `jaideep@archlinux ~`

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image captures a scenario where a user is trying to install the `numpy` package using `pip3` on an Arch Linux system. The initial attempt fails due to the "externally-managed-environment" error, which indicates that the system's Python installation is managed by the OS package manager (pacman). The error message provides guidance on how to install packages in this environment, suggesting the use of `pacman` for system-wide installations or virtual environments for non-Arch-packaged packages.

The user then activates a virtual environment and attempts to install `numpy` again. This time, the installation succeeds because `numpy` is already present in the virtual environment.

Most of your questions and doubts will be solved in todays sessions. First 20 mins will be a clear overview of the logic and workflow and how evaluation actually works.

Rest of the session will be bug fixing and doubts.

Everytime I run datagen.py for the A1 task, the data file gets downloaded in the C drive instead of the current project folder. I even tried to set the current project folder as the root directory but it still downloads the files in C drive and I cant seem to find a workaround this. Can someone please help with this issue. Thanks!

Can you please make the changes in the datagen.py file

config = {“root”: “/data”}

This is where I have been facing the issue.

The only solution I can think of is moving the /data folder from the root to the project directory. which I am not sure is a good way to solve this issue.

you have to give the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to the evaluate.py by either

bash - `export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`

or

powershell - `$env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`

the evaluate.py file takes the token to send request to embedding end point for processing.

so you have to set `AIPROXY_TOKEN` in both terminals

i.e. app.py and evaluate.py teminals

On bash it gives below output. On PowerShell it says missing authorization. A9 is failed.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal window, likely on a Linux or Unix-based system. It displays a sequence of commands and their output. The commands involve setting an environment variable and making an API call using `curl`. The output of the `curl` command is a JSON response.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Shell Prompt:** The terminal prompt indicates the user is "Nelson" and the current directory is "TDS-Project-1-LLM".
*   **Commands:**
    *   `export AIPROXY_TOKEN=eyJhbGci0iJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1bWFpbCI6IjIyZjEwMDEyOTBAZHMuc3R1ZHkuawl0b:` - This command sets an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to a long string, which appears to be a JWT (JSON Web Token). The token is truncated in the image.
    *   `curl -X POST http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["king", "queen"]}'` - This command uses `curl` to make a POST request to an API endpoint.
        *   `-X POST`: Specifies that the request method is POST.
        *   `http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`: The URL of the API endpoint.
        *   `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`: Sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`, indicating that the request body is in JSON format.
        *   `-d '{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["king", "queen"]}'`:  Provides the data to be sent in the POST request. The data is a JSON object with two fields:
            *   `model`: Set to `"text-embedding-3-small"`.
            *   `input`: An array containing the strings `"king"` and `"queen"`.
*   **`curl` Progress Bar:** The output from `curl` shows a progress bar

In PowerShell

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of a PowerShell 7 terminal window.  It displays a `curl` command being executed and the subsequent JSON response received.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Terminal Prompt:** `PS C:\Users\Nelson>`
*   **curl command:**
    ```
    curl -X POST http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $AIPROXY_TOKEN" -d '{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["king", "queen"]}'
    ```
*   **JSON Response:**
    ```json
    {
        "message": "Missing Authorization: Bearer header. See https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy"
    }
    ```

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The user is attempting to make a POST request to an OpenAI embedding endpoint (likely a custom proxy) using `curl`. The request is intended to generate embeddings for the words "king" and "queen" using the "text-embedding-3-small" model. However, the server is returning an error message indicating that the "Authorization: Bearer" header is missing. This suggests that the user has not properly set or passed the API key or token required to authenticate with the service. The error message also provides a link to a GitHub repository related to the AI proxy.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **curl:** A command-line tool used for making HTTP requests.
*   **-X POST:** Specifies that the HTTP method is POST.
*   **http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings:** The URL of the API endpoint being called.
*   **-H "Content-Type: application/json":** Sets the Content-Type header to indicate that the request body is in JSON format.
*   **-H "Authorization: Bearer $AIPROXY_TOKEN":** Sets the Authorization header with a Bearer token. The `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` suggests that the token is being passed as an environment variable

My data is getting generated -

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser window displaying a JSON response. The browser's address bar is visible, and the content of the page is a JSON object. There's also a "Pretty-print" checkbox at the top.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Browser Address Bar:** `127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install%20uv` (The `%20` likely represents a space, so the task is "Install uv").
*   **"Pretty-print"** (next to a checkbox)
*   **JSON Content:**
    *   `{`
    *   `"files": [`
    *   `"comments.txt",`
    *   `"contacts.json",`
    *   `"credit_card.png",`
    *   `"dates.txt",`
    *   `"docs",`
    *   `"email.txt",`
    *   `"format.md",`
    *   `"logs",`
    *   `"ticket-sales-gold.txt",`
    *   `"ticket-sales.db"`
    *   `],`
    *   `"message": "Data generation complete"`
    *   `}`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows the result of a task executed on a local server (likely a development server). The task seems to be related to installing something ("Install uv"). The JSON response indicates that the task involved generating data, and the "files" array lists the files that were created or modified as part of this data generation process. The "message" field confirms that the data generation was completed.

**4. Technical details (JSON):**

The JSON object has two key-value pairs:

*   `"files"`: This key has an array as its value. The array contains a list of strings, each representing a filename or directory name. The files have various extensions like `.txt`, `.json`, `.png`, `.md`, and `.db`, suggesting different types of data (text files, JSON data, image, markdown file, database file).
*   

despite this I am getting an error when evaluating the file with no explanation of the error. Can someone please help with this.

 :yellow_circle:  Running task: Install `uv` (if required) and run the script `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py`

with `user@example.com` as the only argument

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a code editor, likely VS Code, with multiple tabs open. The active tab is named "format.md". The content of "format.md" is displayed in the editor. There are also tabs for ".env", "app.py", and "evaluate.py".

**2. Any text content visible:**

The "format.md" file contains the following text:

```markdown
#Unformatted Markdown

This is a sample paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace.
- First item
- Second item
+Third item
* Fourth item

```
```py
print("user@example.com")
```

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The "format.md" file appears to be a Markdown file containing a heading, a paragraph with formatting issues (extra spaces and trailing whitespace), and a list with different bullet point styles.  Following the markdown, there is a python code block that prints an email address. The file's name suggests it might be used for testing or demonstrating Markdown formatting.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

*   **File Type:** The active file is a Markdown file (".md").
*   **Markdown Syntax:** The file uses Markdown syntax for headings (`#`), lists (`-`, `+`, `*`), and code blocks (```).
*   **Python Code Block:** The file includes a Python code block, indicated by the `py` tag, containing a simple `print` statement.
*   **Email Address:** The Python code prints the string "user@example.com", which resembles an email address.
*   **Formatting Issues:** The paragraph in the Markdown file is described as having "extra spaces and trailing whitespace," indicating potential formatting problems.

Even the markdown file shows the correct email. What are the possible issues that I could be facing with this one.

@s.anand

Respected Sir,

I sincerely request you to kindly consider granting a one-day extension for Project 1. Many key clarifications were provided in today’s session, and we need just one additional day to effectively implement them. This extension would be immensely helpful in ensuring a more refined submission.

I truly appreciate your time and consideration.

Thank you.

hey I have a few doubts, if something was said about this please say so.

in Phase be tasks do we have to store the output in files or just return it in the response
When I call my some of my endpoints using post man or CURL they work but if I run the evaluate.py it throws an error, this I think is a bug in the eval.py file.

any idea about these ?

facing the issue on submission

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a portion of a web form, likely part of a submission or assignment. It contains two questions related to a project: one asking for a GitHub repository link and the other for a DockerHub image name. There are input fields for both questions, and an error message is displayed for the DockerHub image name field.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Question 1:** "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1? *"
*   **Example GitHub link:** "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name"
*   **User's GitHub link input:** "https://github.com/rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Ja"
*   **Question 2:** "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub? *"
*   **Example DockerHub image name:** "It should look like user-name/image-name"
*   **User's DockerHub image name input:** "rsjay1976/tds-project1-Jan25"
*   **Error message:** "Must match pattern" (accompanied by a red exclamation point icon)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The form is designed to collect information about a project, specifically the location of the code on GitHub and the DockerHub image associated with it. The asterisk (*) next to the questions indicates that they are required fields. The error message suggests that the user's input for the DockerHub image name does not conform to the expected format or a predefined pattern. The expected pattern is "user-name/image-name".

**4. Technical details:**

The image doesn't contain code or technical diagrams. It's a UI element, specifically a form with input fields and validation. The "Must match pattern" error suggests that there's a regular expression or other validation rule in place to ensure the DockerHub image name is in the correct format. The user's input "rsjay1976/tds-project1-Jan25" likely fails this validation, possibly due to character restrictions, length limitations, or other criteria.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **What is shown in the image:** The image displays a traceback from a Python program. It shows an error message related to the OpenAI library.

2.  **Text content visible:**
    *   `File "/app/app.py", line 35, in `
    *   `client = OpenAI(`
    *   `AAAAAAA`
    *   `File "/usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/openai/_client.py", line 110, in __init__`
    *   `raise OpenAIError(`
    *   `openai.OpenAIError: The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable`

3.  **Context/Purpose:** The traceback indicates that the program is trying to initialize an OpenAI client without providing an API key. The error message explains that the API key must be provided either directly to the client during initialization or by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. The `AAAAAAA` likely indicates where the API key should have been provided in the code.

4.  **Technical Details:**
    *   The error originates from the `openai` library, specifically within the `_client.py` file in the `__init__` method.
    *   The program's main file is `app.py`, and the error occurs on line 35.
    *   The Python version being used is 3.12.
    *   The error is an `OpenAIError`, which is a custom exception defined within the `openai` library.

can someone help me fix this error @Jivraj @carlton

for the datagen script is it ok to hardcode the scripts url and my email id? I understand the script itself may change but can I count on the link remaining the same? Also is it necessary to pass the email as argument?

Blunder in your `main.py`.

You are using API_KEY = os.getenv(“AI_PROXY_TOKEN”) but it should be AIPROXY_TOKEN.

Btw what you using for phase B?

What we expect in project.

server running inside docker container at 8000.
And all files will be accessed from data folder in root directory.

Apart from these two you can have anything extra.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-15 212826**
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

*   The image shows a terminal output, likely from a PowerShell or similar command-line interface.
*   It displays the output of a `docker build` command, including the steps involved in building a Docker image.
*   The build process encounters an error while trying to load metadata for a specific Docker image.
*   It also shows the content of a Dockerfile.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Command Prompt:**
    *   `PS C:\Projects\tds_project_1> docker login`
    *   `Authenticating with existing credentials...`
    *   `Login Succeeded`
    *   `PS C:\Projects\tds_project_1> docker build -t pratik007thala/automation-agent .`
*   **Docker Build Output:**
    *   `[+] Building 3.4s (3/3) FINISHED`
    *   `docker: desktop-linux`
    *   `=> [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile 0.1s`
    *   `=> => transferring dockerfile: 855B 0.1s`

**Subject:** Request for Project Deadline Extension

Dear Sir,

This project is highly complex, and we need additional time to ensure its successful completion. We kindly request an extension of the deadline to allow for thorough testing and proper implementation. An extension would greatly help us deliver the best results.

Thank you for your understanding  @Jivraj @carlton  @s.anand

This might be problem with network settings(unstable internet, firewall, VPN interference)

try to debug it with help of chatgpt.

You can also use codespaces for trying another network.

if you do that then during evaluation, it would use your credit limit. if it gets exhausted, you may face problems. @23f2003413

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a file explorer or project structure view, likely from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code or PyCharm. It shows a hierarchical tree of folders and files within a project.

**2. Text Content:**

The visible text content includes:

*   **Project Names:** "TDS-Project-1", "tds-project-1"
*   **Folders:** "\_pycache\_", ".venv", "app", "data"
*   **Files:** "\_\_init\_\_.py", "funtion\_tasks.py", "main.py", "task\_to\_embed.txt", ".gitignore", "datagen.py", "Dockerfile", "evaluate.py", "README.md", "LICENSE"
*   **Version Control/Status Indicators:** "2, U", "3, U" (likely indicating modified files in a version control system like Git)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows the organization of a Python project. The presence of folders like "app" and "data", along with files like "main.py", "datagen.py", and "evaluate.py", suggests a project that involves data processing, application logic, and evaluation. The "task\_to\_embed.txt" file hints at a task embedding or natural language processing component. The "Dockerfile" indicates that the project is containerized.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **File Types:** The ".py" extension indicates Python source code files. ".txt" is a plain text file. ".md" is a Markdown file (often used for README files).
*   **\_\_init\_\_.py:** This file is used to mark directories on disk as Python package directories.
*   **.gitignore:** This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   **\_pycache\_:** This folder is automatically created by Python to store compiled bytecode files.
*   **.venv:** This folder typically contains a virtual environment, which isolates project dependencies.
*   **Version Control:** The "2, U" and "3, U" next to "datagen.py" and "evaluate.py" respectively likely indicate that these files have been modified (U = Updated) and

this is what i am doing first using the podman given in the portal and then running the evaluate.py file

No don’t do that, just follow the procedure.

Two problems with keeping token in file.

It will become public after you push to github.
While running evaluation script after submission your token might run out of credits.

@Jivraj sir   @carlton    sir do have to add datagen in the docker container?

As when I’m running it locally, it gives 9/10, but when I pull it from Hub and run eval, it says:detail": “[Errno 2] No such file or directory: ‘/data/datagen.py’”

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) displaying a JSON response. It appears to be from a tool used for making and inspecting API requests, such as Postman or Insomnia. The UI has tabs for "Response," "Headers," "Cookies," "Results," and "Docs." The "Response" tab is currently selected. The main content area shows a formatted JSON object. There's also a "Copy" button.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Tabs:** Response, Headers, Cookies, Results, Docs
*   **Headers:** The "Headers" tab has a number "5" next to it, likely indicating the number of headers in the response.
*   **JSON Content:**
    *   `{`
    *   `"detail": "Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}"`
    *   `}`
*   **Button:** Copy

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows an error response from an API. The error indicates that the authentication token being used is not valid because it's not from a trusted issuer. This suggests there's a problem with the authentication configuration or the token itself. The "Copy" button allows the user to copy the JSON response for further analysis or debugging.

**4. Technical details (JSON structure):**

The JSON response has a single key, `"detail"`. The value associated with `"detail"` is a string that contains:

*   An error code: "401" (HTTP status code for Unauthorized).
*   A nested JSON-like structure within the string, representing the error details. This nested structure has:
    *   An `"error"` key, which is an object containing:
        *   `"message"`: A human-readable error message: "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer."
        *   `"type"`: "invalid\_request\_error", indicating the type of error.
        *   `"param"`: "None", suggesting no specific parameter caused the error.
        *   `

someone please help me fix this error

On my system evaulate.py is throwing an error on A2 trying to execute npx on format.md before the llm is even invoked. However running the command directly on the command line works.

evaluate.py:

 :red_circle:  A2 failed: Command ‘[‘npx’, ‘prettier@3.4.2’, ‘–stdin-filepath’, ‘data/format.md’]’ returned non-zero exit status 2.

 :x:  A2 FAILED

bash:

npx prettier@3.4.2 --stdin-filepath data/format.md

bash works as expected. Can someone help?

@carlton @Jivraj

Hi ,

I am trying to build using both docker and podman but it failed on both. I have watched many videos trying to resolve this adn also chatgpt in order to resolve the issue but it seems to persist. I even uninstalled and reinstalled both podman and doceker multiple times but no help.

When i run command docker build -t ___________ .

the error that comes is :

2 | >>> FROM python:3.12-slim

Even tried getting python:3.12-slim separatly and trying again but that also didn’t work.

I think there is some problem in getting python:3.12-slim as the build always stops at this.

on asking ChatGPT it shows that some DNS or network issue is there. I even tried all the remedy that was provided on creating custom network etc. but this was also of no use

Kindly help me finding solution to this and pls mention any other assistance I may require to get this running

Thank You.

Regards,

Aagman

@carlton needed a confirmation on this task

`A8 * `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt` - in this task i assume prompt can ask for credit card number or other details like cvv and name.

My question is, whether my system should allow prompt that CVV or or such info ? or should give it ?

Previously I asked for some more credits to test my project. I got an email stating I have been provided with a new token but I think I got that same token again, not a new one. I still cant send request to the AIPROXY. Please help.

Do I need to submit the docker image name with the tag or without the tag? I submitted it before without the tag. Now i see that I have tagged the image with as v1 but I cant submit the form due to pattern matching problems. Should i submit again after tagging it with :latest ?

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

When I run my docker image using

`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

Task A2 fails as the podman container is unable to find npx.

Running the same image using

`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

works fine and Task A2 passes. I can’t understand why this is happening.

I also ran the image in both docker and podman in interactive mode as show in the below snippet from terminal.

When run using docker, `which node` gives `/usr/bin/node` as output but when run using podman, nothing.

shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo podman run --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh
# echo $PATH
/root/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
# which node
# exit
shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo docker run --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh
# echo $PATH
/root/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
# which node
/usr/bin/node
# exit
shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo podman run --user=root --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh

Here’s how to prompt folks. Just do what @carlton mentioned in today’s live session (the 5 hour marathon) and you should be good for Project-1!

      [x.com](https://x.com/aakashg0/status/1890492955842007087?s=46&t=U3mfkIFH433B6kVe5ZktSw)

  Most people are still prompting wrong.

I've found this framework, which was even shared by OpenAI President Greg Brockman.

Here’s how it works: pic.x.com/2MMcEqBeIJ

sir I am noticing a pattern, that when I am running the datagen first. And then using the evaluate.py, then I am getting the A2 right.

But running the evaluation.py for the 2nd time cause the A2 to fail…

Probabbly Because the file in the data folder gets upated should I worry for that…

in the phase B, we have no idea about how many arguments are there, so should we make every function mapping with 2 arguments ( 1 containing the input location and other containing output location) or should we take the parameters in some other way

There has been an outage in some parts of the country related to cloudflare servers. What helped some students (and us) is using a completely different network eg. instead of using your home wifi, use mobile internet, since they go through a different DNS and this sometimes works.

Kind regards

We have not specified a size limit for the docker image, so in theory there is not a limit to the docker image size.

Kind regards

Hello  @carlton Sir,

While running evaluate.py , I have observed that the expected  and actual output is having difference like “\n” then also it marks task as fail.

eg:

 :warning:  EXPECTED:

Cover west give likely individual though question inside. System many human plant card among provide. Large former seek mouth there long.

Attention officer successful. Us population the true show.

Real cold if play side wind affect. Street cause investment receive have miss page station.

Meeting back page exactly itself book forward. Decision western series under from shoulder. Pay during feeling newspaper human. Professional old recent beyond girl three human.

Difficult yourself build increase back put others.

Although artist operation thing skin lead. Billion deep measure down adult suggest. Anything action start artist when first.

Whole way know down. Music machine trip father rather.

Must medical bad law issue.

Someone explain seven maintain wrong day factor property.

 :warning:  RESULT:

“Cover west give likely individual though question inside. System many human plant card among provide. Large former seek mouth there long.\nAttention officer successful. Us population the true show.\nReal cold if play side wind affect. Street cause investment receive have miss page station.\nCold rest term her conference.

 :x:  A5 FAILED

Will this be considered as failure in actual evaluation as well or will this be taken care in actual evaluation?

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. UI Elements:**

*   **Browser Window:** The image shows a web browser window, likely Chrome or a similar Chromium-based browser.
*   **Tabs:** There are two tabs visible. One is labeled "127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install uv" and the other is labeled "Settings". There is also a new tab button.
*   **Address Bar:** The address bar contains the URL: "127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install%20uv%20(if%20required)%20and%20run%20https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py" (URL-encoded).
*   **"Pretty-print" Checkbox:** There's a checkbox labeled "Pretty-print". It appears to be unchecked.
*   **JSON Output:** Below the checkbox, there's a block of text that looks like JSON output.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **URL:** The URL in the address bar is a local address (127.0.0.1:8000) with a query string. The query string specifies a "task" that involves installing something ("uv") and then running a Python script from a raw GitHubusercontent URL.
*   **JSON Output:** The JSON output contains the following:
    *   `"success": "Executed https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py with email trial@gmail.com"`

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows the result of a web request to a local server (likely a development server). The request instructs the server to install something (possibly a Python package or tool named "uv") and then execute a Python script (`datagen.py`) located in a GitHub repository. The server's response, displayed as JSON, indicates that the script was successfully executed, and it mentions that it was run "with email trial@gmail.com

Im able to execute the query succesfully.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a Windows File Explorer window. The window is displaying the contents of a folder named "data". The left pane shows the navigation pane with common locations like Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos, and some user-created folders. The right pane displays the files and folders within the "data" directory.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Window Title:** "data"
*   **Address Bar:** "This PC > Acer (C:) > data"
*   **Toolbar:** "New", "Sort", "View"
*   **Navigation Pane:** "Desktop", "Downloads", "Documents", "Pictures", "Music", "Videos", "TDS assignments 4", "Ilm-automation-agent"
*   **File List Columns:** "Name", "Date modified", "Type", "Size"
*   **File/Folder Names:**
    *   "docs" (File folder)
    *   "logs" (File folder)
    *   "comments" (Text Source File)
    *   "contacts" (JSON Source File)
    *   "credit\_card" (PNG File)
    *   "dates" (Text Source File)
    *   "email" (Text Source File)
    *   "format" (Markdown Source File)
    *   "ticket-sales" (Data Base File)
*   **File Types:** "File folder", "Text Source File", "JSON Source File", "PNG File", "Markdown Source File", "Data Base File"
*   **File Sizes:** "10 KB", "9 KB", "5 KB", "15 KB", "1 KB", "32 KB"
*   **Date Modified:** All files and folders have a "Date modified" of "16-02-2025" and times ranging from "11:56" to "11:58".

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows a user browsing the contents of a "data" folder on their computer. The folder contains a mix of file types, including text files, JSON files, a PNG image, a Markdown file, and a database file.

But the data gets downloaded to C drive instead of the project folder

The datagen.py file is in the project folder itself.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a snippet of Python code within a code editor. The code is related to setting up a project directory structure, specifically ensuring that all files are accessed from a 'data' folder within the project root.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The code includes the following text:

*   `# Ensure all files are accessed from the 'data' folder inside the project root`
*   `PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())`
*   `DATA_DIR = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "data")`
*   `# Ensure the 'data' directory exists`
*   `os.makedirs(DATA_DIR, exist_ok=True)`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The code aims to:

*   Define the project root directory.
*   Create a 'data' directory within the project root.
*   Ensure that the 'data' directory exists, creating it if it doesn't.

This is a common practice in software development to organize project files and data in a structured manner.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The code uses the `os` module, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
*   `os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())` gets the absolute path of the current working directory and assigns it to `PROJECT_ROOT`.
*   `os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "data")` joins the project root path with the "data" string to create the full path to the data directory.
*   `os.makedirs(DATA_DIR, exist_ok=True)` creates the directory specified by `DATA_DIR`. The `exist_ok=True` argument prevents an error if the directory already exists.

am I making any error when setting the directories?

Please help, have been facing this issue since the beginning of this project, initially tried to move the files from C drive to project folder but that does not seem like a viable solution.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a code snippet, specifically a Python function definition. It appears to be part of a larger script that automates the process of downloading, installing, and running another Python script.

**2. Text Content:**

The code includes the following key text elements:

*   **Function Definition:** `def run_datagen(task_description):`
*   **Regular Expressions:**
    *   `re.search(r"https?://[^\s]+\.py", task_description)` (for extracting a URL ending in ".py")
    *   `re.search(r"[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}", task_description)` (for extracting an email address)
*   **Error Handling:** `return {"error": "URL or email not found in the prompt."}`
*   **File Operations:** `os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "datagen.py")`, `open(script_path, "wb")`, `f.write(response.content)`
*   **Subprocess Calls:** `subprocess.run(["uv", "--version"], ...)` , `subprocess.run(["pip", "install", "uv"], ...)` , `subprocess.run(["python", script_path, user_email], ...)`
*   **Return Value:** `return {"success": f"Executed {script_url} with email {user_email}"}`
*   **Comments:** Several comments explain the purpose of different code sections (e.g., "# Extract URL and email from task description", "# Download script", "# Check if UV is installed", "# Run the script with user email")

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The `run_datagen` function aims to:

1.  **Extract a URL and email address** from a given `task_description` string using regular expressions.
2.  **Download a Python script** from the extracted URL.
3.  **Save the downloaded script** to a file named "datagen.py" within a project directory (defined by `PROJECT_ROOT`).
4.  **Check if the `uv` package is installed.** If not

I am also running datagen.py in the project directory, yet data folder is created in C drive.

@jkmadathil @carlton @Jivraj

Sir earlier my code was running fine, but after the assigment of the new token,

it is now showing 400 bad request, which simply implies there is something wrong with the token…

plz do something sir…

**Image: image**
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows text output, likely from a server log or console, indicating HTTP requests and responses. The text is displayed in a monospaced font on a dark background, typical of terminal or code editor environments.

**2. Text Content:**

The image contains the following text:

*   **INFO:** (appears twice, indicating log messages)
*   **127.0.0.1:51794** (IP address and port number)
*   **- "POST /run?task=The+SQLite+database+file+%60%2Fdata%2Fticket-sales.db%60+has+a+%60tickets%60+with+columns+%60type%60C+%60units%60%2C+and+%60price%60.+Each+row+is+a+customer+bid+for+a+concert+ticket.+What+is+the+total+sales+of+all+the+items+in+the+%22Gold%22+ticket+type%3F+Write+the+number+in+%60%2Fdata%2Fticket-sales-gold.txt%60 HTTP/1.1"** (A URL-encoded POST request)
*   **400 Bad Request** (HTTP response status code and message)
*   **127.0.0.1:51797** (IP address and port number)
*   **- "GET /read?path=/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt HTTP/1.1"** (A GET request)
*   **404 Not Found** (HTTP response status code and message)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows a server receiving HTTP requests and responding with error codes.

*   The first request is a POST request to the `/run` endpoint. The `task` parameter in the query string contains a complex, URL-encoded string that describes a task involving an SQLite database named `ticket-sales.db`. The task seems to be querying the database to calculate the total sales of "Gold" tickets and writing the result to a file named `ticket-sales-gold

I have do have cross verified the new token been correctly been assigned to the system variable…

Use following as first parameter of `subprocess.run()` to create `data/` directory inside your project instead of C: drive

["uv", "run", script_url, user_email, "--root", "./data"]

Also, you don’t need to download to script, you can directly run it from the url.

The reason for error is `evaluate.py` is trying to import `datagen.py` which doesn’t exist in your system. I’ll suggest download both the files, keep them in same folder and run `evaluate.py` from your computer

Generation-Based Automation Agent (No Hard Coding)

**Repository Link:** [GitHub - 23f2005593/tds](https://github.com/23f2005593/tds)

Currently, it can complete 7 out of 10 tasks. In reality, it can complete 9 out of 10 tasks, but the expected results are not flexible in evaluate.py file.

If we can extract credit card numbers, it will be able to complete 10 out of 10 tasks.

Please contribute to this repository. **We will win together.**

sir for this task- A6 Find all Markdown (`.md` ) files in `/data/docs/` . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `# ` ). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}` )   …I am getting correct result for all files but for the very first file budget.md it shows wrong.

my result- { “budget.md”: “Success easy same main modern doctor.”,

“build.md”: “Shoulder follow own never above.”,

and in the data files there is different heading in budget.md.-  # Series dog who make specific agree between.

my question is this if it works for all the files then why not for this file budget.md    @Saransh_Saini  @Jivraj @carlton

If filename has number in its name then extract the number from the filename and convert it to an integer before sorting .Ensure numbers inside filenames are compared as integers, not as strings, to maintain proper order. Sort filenames in said in task. Avoid any lexicographical sorting issues.    i am using this extra info for doing this but still it does not give accurate result. can you help me in this

Check the file once, there is a possibility that it’s either fetching a comment or the second heading. Refactor your prompt to search only for the First Heading, specify it explixitly.

This is happening because evaluate.py is unable to fetch your API Key from the environment variables. Create a new variable and set it’s value to your API Key then try.

Hi everyone,

I’m running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to:

bash

Copy

https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings

I receive a **401 Unauthorized** response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a `KeyError: 'data'` because the expected JSON response doesn’t include the `"data"` key.

What I’ve Tried

**Token Verification:**

I’m using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` obtained by logging in at [aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) with my IITM email.
The token is passed in the header as follows:

python

Copy

"Authorization": f"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}"

I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).

**API Request Details:**

The request includes the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header.
The payload is set as:

json

Copy

{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["Test"]}

Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.

**Debug Output:**

Here’s a snippet of the debug output:

bash

Copy

HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"
🔴 A9 failed: 'data'

This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic.

What I Suspect

The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.
There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of.
Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.

Request for Help

Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database

Should I ask for the SQL data base. Or the agent should be smart enough to find the required database…

Moreover in the data folder there is only one database is it should be robust to handle multiple databases…

I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using `podman rmi -a` and then ran `podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME` with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1). But this gave me the following error:

Error: short-name "freshbash/dataworks-agent" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf

The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation.

The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be `docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent`

I’m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful. Thanks!

Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **UI Elements:** The image shows a section of a user interface, likely from a cloud service or development platform. It displays information about resource usage and billing related to "Codespaces." The UI includes text labels, numerical values, progress bars, and a link.

2.  **Text Content:**
    *   **Title:** "Codespaces" with a code icon next to it.
    *   **Subtitle:** "Included quotas reset in 10 days. See billing documentation"
    *   **Usage Hours:** "Usage hours" with a right-pointing arrow (likely indicating an expandable section). "172.37 of 180.00 included core hours used"
    *   **Storage:** "Storage" with a right-pointing arrow. "9.21 of 20.00 included GB-month used"
    *   **Spending Limit:** "$0.00 monthly spending limit | Set up a spending limit"
    *   **Cost:** "$0.00" appears three times, likely indicating the current cost for each resource category.

3.  **Context/Purpose:** The purpose of this UI section is to provide users with an overview of their Codespaces resource consumption and billing status. It shows how much of their included usage hours and storage they have used, and their current monthly spending. The "Set up a spending limit" link suggests that users can control their costs by setting a limit.

4.  **Technical Details:**
    *   **Resource Usage:** The image shows that the user has used 172.37 out of 180 included core hours and 9.21 out of 20 included GB-month of storage.
    *   **Progress Bars:** There are two progress bars. The first, colored red, represents the usage hours, and it's nearly full. The second, colored blue, represents storage usage, and it's less than half full.
    *   **Billing:** The current cost for both usage hours and storage is $0.00, and the monthly spending limit is also $0.00. This suggests that the user is currently within their included quotas or has not incurred any charges.
    *   **Quotas:** The text "Included quotas reset in 10

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-16 091101**

The image shows a user interface (UI) section related to "Codespaces," likely from a cloud-based development environment or platform. It displays usage statistics for resources like core hours and storage.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Codespaces:** The title of the section.
*   **Included quotas reset in 13 days. See billing documentation:** A message indicating when the usage quotas will reset and a link to billing documentation.
*   **Usage hours:** A label for the usage hours section.
*   **120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used:** Indicates that all included core hours have been used.
*   **$0.00:** The cost associated with the usage hours.
*   **Storage:** A label for the storage section.
*   **1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used:** Indicates the amount of storage used out of the included storage.
*   **$0.00:** The cost associated with the storage usage.

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The purpose of this UI section is to provide users with an overview of their Codespaces resource usage. It shows how much of their included quotas they have consumed for core hours and storage, and the associated costs. This helps users manage their resource consumption and avoid unexpected charges.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **UI Elements:** The UI includes labels, numerical values, progress bars (for usage), and potentially interactive elements (the ">" symbols suggest expandable sections).
*   **Progress Bars:** The progress bar for "Usage hours" is completely filled and colored red, indicating that the user has reached their limit. The progress bar for "Storage" is partially filled and colored blue, indicating that the user has not reached their limit.
*   **Units:** The units for usage are "core hours" and "GB-month."
*   **Cost:** The cost is displayed in US dollars ($).

Hardest i ever worked in my life. Thank you @s.anand

Hey I just got a mail saying that my github repo has no Dockerfile present. and im confused .

It doesnt mention anywhere that the dockerfile must be present in the root directory as a requirement/prerequisite of the project.

In my case its present inside the app directory. Could the team help clarify on this issue.

I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.

Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

Dear @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj , and @Saransh_Saini

Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.

@carlton Sir, yesterday’s session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.

Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.

I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.

How long does it take to make a docker image, I’ve been doing it for the past 25 minutes and it’s still not completed.

Your LLM app should be designed like it can give desire result based on task desc at run endpoint, and that result should be accessible at read endpoint.

Evaluation file just for reference to check how things works and it works for phase A tasks only. Also ensure datagen.py file and evaluation.py file are latest. There is one issue in evaluation.py file for task A1,  link of datagen.py file not correct, rectify that link. Even it corrected in GitHub repo file but when I download that raw file in local system it takes back previous link.

It was tough… I will probably not score much but I enjoyed it a lot. Thank you for pushing us so hard. At least I am not scared of docker now and function calling feels easier than before.

@s.anand @carlton

Dear Sir,

I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.

I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.

I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.

I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.

Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.

Sincerely,

Rishit Jain

(24F2004595)

Although couldn’t complete handling every task, but really enjoyed working on this project and learned a lot throughout the process. I appreciate the opportunity to work on such an engaging project. For Project 2, I’ll make sure to allocate sufficient time and approach it with even greater commitment.

I don’t think the project is too difficult to implement—it’s essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren’t very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do.

Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?

@s.anand

@carlton sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.

I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.

Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task_handler.py file of my repository.

I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely.

I would like to sincerely thank the course faculty @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini for their support on the project throughout the week. They were so patient in listening to our issues and helping us resolve them, even if the issues were repeated.

I was not able to complete some or maybe many of the tasks but overall, it was a very good learning for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Thanks very much again for your guidance and support.

I have received a mail that my project has ""No “MIT” in LICENSE;No Dockerfile " which I saw today. My project has MIT licence and Dockerfile was also there… but to reconfirm I pulled my dockerfile from dockerhub to github only . NOw am not sure will that be considered now in my project submission or not. Requesting to kindly consider current state of my project in submission for my project.

I noticed something quite funny. The project never specified the required tech stack, so one could have done this entirely with JavaScript as well, assuming the necessary libraries are installed.

@TheVishal

EDIT: Create a new docker image with the mistaken image name , so when they pull image from repo, that image with the wrong name also gets pulled.

what to do

push a new image with the mistaken name, so in your repo there will be two images

how will this help?
since you are unsure, which image link you posted, you can be sure that even you had a mistake in link, a new image will exist with the wrong name after you push another image

@all

use this to update your image even after submission, as now they only validate the images, they do not pull it so you can edit your project and add more functionality if they release the code solutiion

CHEERS

Andrew OUT.

I didn’t submit the google form, I have made the github repo and docker image for TDS project 1. I, mistakenly, thought that I had submitted the google form but actually it was saved as a draft and closed my laptop. As soon as I realized my mistake, I hit the submit button but this was shown then,

“The form TDS Jan 2025 - Project 1 Submission is no longer accepting responses.”

I apologize for this. I have been working on this project for weeks.

This was my first TDS project. I would highly appreciated, if you could help me.

Thank you, sir, for giving us this amazing opportunity! Honestly, I learned more in the last week than I did throughout the three modules.

The project was a rollercoaster ride—especially with all the errors that kept popping up—but overall, the experience was incredibly enriching. The amount of knowledge I gained was truly valuable.

A huge thanks to @Carlton, @Saransh_Saini, and @Jivraj sir for their guidance and support. Without the last week’s lectures, the project couldn’t have been completed.

EDIT:

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-16 091101**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) section related to "Codespaces," likely from a cloud-based development environment or platform. It displays usage statistics for resources like core hours and storage.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Codespaces:** The title of the section.
*   **Included quotas reset in 13 days. See billing documentation:** A message indicating the reset period for included quotas and a link to billing documentation.
*   **Usage hours:** A label for the usage hours section.
*   **120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used:** Shows the amount of core hours used out of the included quota.
*   **Storage:** A label for the storage section.
*   **1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used:** Shows the amount of storage used out of the included quota.
*   **$0.00:** Indicates the cost associated with each resource usage.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The purpose of this UI section is to inform the user about their resource usage within Codespaces. It shows how much of their included quotas for core hours and storage they have consumed. The "Included quotas reset in 13 days" message suggests a recurring billing cycle or quota refresh period. The cost being $0.00 implies that the user is currently within their included quotas and not incurring additional charges.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The UI uses progress bars to visually represent the usage of core hours and storage. The core hours progress bar is full and red, indicating that the user has used all of their included core hours. The storage progress bar is partially filled and blue, indicating that the user has used a portion of their included storage.
*   The text "120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used" indicates that the user has reached their limit for core hours.
*   The text "1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used" indicates that the user has used 1.46 GB-month of storage out of the 15.00 GB-month included.
*   The presence of the "See

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-17 200414**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. UI Elements:**

*   **Title:** "Your codespaces" in large, white text.
*   **Buttons:** Two buttons are visible in the top right corner:
    *   "Go to docs" (dark grey background)
    *   "New codespace" (green background)
*   **Alert Box:** A rectangular box with a dark red background. This box contains an alert message.

**2. Text Content:**

*   "Your codespaces"
*   "Go to docs"
*   "New codespace"
*   Inside the alert box:
    *   An exclamation mark inside a stop sign-like icon.
    *   "You're at 100% of your included usage for this billing period. For more information, view your billing settings." The "billing settings" part is a hyperlink (indicated by the blue underline).

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The image appears to be a screenshot from a web application, likely a cloud-based development environment or platform like GitHub Codespaces. The "Your codespaces" title suggests a section dedicated to managing or viewing the user's codespace instances. The alert message indicates that the user has reached their usage limit for the current billing cycle. The link to "billing settings" allows the user to review their plan and potentially upgrade or adjust their usage.

**4. Technical Details:**

The image shows a UI element that is likely part of a web application. The alert message suggests that the application is tracking resource usage (likely CPU time, storage, or network bandwidth) associated with the user's codespaces. The alert is triggered when the user's usage reaches 100% of their allocated limit for the billing period. The "Go to docs" button likely links to the application's documentation, while the "New codespace" button allows the user to create a new development environment.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-17 200525**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) section related to "Codespaces," likely from a cloud-based development environment or platform. It displays usage statistics for included quotas, specifically for usage hours and storage.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Codespaces:** The title of the section.
*   **Included quotas reset in 8 days. See billing documentation:**  A message indicating the reset period for included quotas and a link to billing documentation.
*   **Usage hours:** A label for the usage hours section.
*   **180.00 of 180.00 included core hours used:**  Indicates that all 180 included core hours have been used.
*   **$0.00:** The cost associated with the usage hours.
*   **Storage:** A label for the storage section.
*   **9.60 of 20.00 included GB-month used:** Indicates that 9.60 GB-month of the included 20 GB-month storage has been used.
*   **$0.00:** The cost associated with the storage usage.

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The purpose of this UI section is to inform the user about their Codespaces usage, specifically how much of their included quotas for usage hours and storage they have consumed. It also indicates when the quotas will reset and provides a link to billing documentation.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **UI Elements:** The UI includes labels, numerical values, progress bars (represented by colored bars), and potentially expandable sections (indicated by the ">" symbols).
*   **Progress Bars:** A red progress bar indicates that all usage hours have been used. A blue progress bar indicates that some storage has been used, but there is still space available.
*   **Color Coding:** The use of red for the usage hours progress bar might indicate that the quota has been fully consumed, potentially leading to additional charges. Blue for storage indicates that there is still space available.
*   **Units:** The units for usage are "core hours" and for storage are "GB-month."

@carlton @Jivraj Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 12.58.15 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **What is shown in the image:** The image contains a single line of text.

2.  **Text content:** The text reads: "P1 and P2 will have two components - Submissions and peer reviews with weightage 80:20."

3.  **Context/Purpose:** The text appears to be describing the grading or evaluation criteria for two projects or assignments, labeled "P1" and "P2." Each project will be assessed based on two components: "Submissions" and "peer reviews." The "weightage 80:20" indicates that submissions contribute 80% to the final grade, while peer reviews contribute 20%.

4.  **Technical Details:** There are no technical details or code snippets in the image. It's simply a statement of grading policy.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.00.50 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a table-like structure, likely a snippet from a form or a report. It consists of three rows and one column.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Row 1:** "Peer Review Date"
*   **Row 2:** "-" (a hyphen or dash)
*   **Row 3:** "Tuesday, February 25, 2025"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image likely represents a section related to peer review dates. The first row labels the field as "Peer Review Date." The second row contains a dash, which could indicate that the peer review date is either not yet available, not applicable, or has not been entered. The third row shows a specific date, "Tuesday, February 25, 2025." This could be a scheduled date, a completed date, or a target date related to the peer review process.

**4. Technical details:**

The image appears to be a simple table or form element. There are no visible code snippets or complex diagrams. The layout is straightforward, with text centered within each cell.

This project is one of the best experiences I had in the entire degree program. I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days >> last 3 months.

I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing.

Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like @23f1002382 and also got the chance to help a few.

I thank the entire TDS team - @s.anand sir, @carlton , @Jivraj for their support throughout this amazing experience.

Regards,

Pradeep Mondal

    "type": "json",

                            "module": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "Name of the python module"
                            }
                        },
                        "required": ["module"],
                        "additionalProperties": False
                    }
            }
        }
    }
}
}

It clearly says in your error message:

Invalid value: ‘json’

if you look at the “type” key in your response_format variable at the top,

the value cannot be “json”

The error is telling you what the supported values are

‘json_object’, ‘json_schema’, and ‘text’

Since you are defining a schema the correct value should be ‘json_schema’

So therefore you should change

"type": "json"

to

"type": "json_schema"

If you have trouble constructing Json schemas,

either feed it to gpt and have it correct it (along with your error) or please go over Module 3, in particular

[https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction)

There is a clear example you can use as a template. We use the same one as a template when we do it in the sessions. That way you will make less errors.

Kind regards

No human peer reviews. The peer will be an LLM that has been given the rubrics and fine tuned.

I know this is a late reply, but its not possible for us to consider changes to your project after the deadline for academic integrity purposes.

If we were to allow it, we would have to allow everyone to make changes to their project as well for it to be fair.

Alright, @Carlton. No problem at all, and thank you for your response.

I just wanted to bring a small limitation in my project’s LLM function to your attention, which I discovered after submission. It may impact one or two tasks. However, no concerns—this has been a great learning experience.

And if possible, just add one line in your Evaluation LLM prompt: *“Give loose marking for effort!”*—because, you know, creativity deserves some extra credit!  :slightly_smiling_face:

I would like to request some bonus like 0.5 bonus mark for each day of delay from the original expected date of receiving score for Project 1 (will be life-saving for us and will be an incentive for team to release scores quickly; or request to TAs if you had better ideas for helping us score more in Project 1)!  :smiley:

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a list of checks or tests, likely related to a software project or assignment. Each line represents a specific criterion, and the result of the check (PASS or FAIL) is indicated. There's also a final score for "Project 1".

**2. Text Content:**

*   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL" (This line is circled in red)
*   "Is Github repo present AND public: PASS"
*   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS"
*   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS"
*   "Prerequisites: FAIL" (This line is underlined in red)
*   "Project 1 Score: 0"
*   "???" (Handwritten in red)

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The image appears to be a status report or checklist for a project. It's assessing whether certain conditions are met, such as the presence of a Docker image on Docker Hub, a public GitHub repository, a Dockerfile, and an MIT license. The "Prerequisites" and "Project 1 Score" suggest this is part of a grading or evaluation process.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The image relates to software development and deployment practices, specifically using Docker and GitHub.
*   The checks indicate a focus on open-source licensing (MIT license) and containerization (Docker).
*   The "Dockerfile" check suggests the project is designed to be containerized.
*   The handwritten "???" suggests confusion or a question about the Dockerfile check.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a table-like UI element, likely from a website or application. It displays information about repositories or projects, with columns for "Last Pushed," "Contains," and "Visibility." There are two rows of data.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Column Headers:**
    *   Last Pushed
    *   Contains
    *   Visibility
*   **Data Rows:**
    *   Row 1: "about 2 hours ago", "IMAGE", "Public"
    *   Row 2: "2 months ago", "IMAGE", "Public"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The UI appears to be displaying a list of repositories or projects, showing when they were last updated (pushed to), whether they contain images, and their visibility status (public). The "Last Pushed" column has an upward arrow, indicating that the data is sorted in ascending order based on the last push time.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The "Contains" column likely indicates whether the repository contains image files.
*   The "Visibility" column indicates that both repositories are publicly accessible.
*   The UI uses a dark theme.
*   The red circles around the word "Public" in the first row are likely annotations added to highlight that specific element.

***This docker image has outlived many students’ hopes, dreams and ambitions of passing this course.***

**Why is it still not being detected properly on the docker hub?**

What in the April Fools is this  :unamused_face: 

It hasn’t even been morning yet!

PS ( @carlton @Jivraj ): My P1 submission had passed all the basic sanity checks on 15th February. No breaking modifications to the Github repo nor the DockerHub image have been made since then. There’s something bugged in your scripts. Kindly check.

*   **Navigation Bar:** At the top, there's a browser navigation bar with the GitHub URL and various tabs (Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, Settings).
*   **Repository Header:** Displays the repository name "TDS\_Project\_1" and its public status.
*   **Branch Information:** Shows the current branch ("main"), the number of branches (1), and the number of tags (0).
*   **File List:** A list of files and directories in the repository, including `_pycache_`, `data`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`.

The image shows a terminal window, likely running in a Unix-like environment (possibly within Windows using a tool like Git Bash or WSL). The terminal displays a series of commands and their outputs.

**2. Text Content:**

The terminal output includes the following:

*   `hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~ (main)`: This is the shell prompt. It indicates the username (`hsent`), the hostname (`DESKTOP-89FBVHS`), the environment (`MINGW64`), the current directory (`~`, which is the home directory), and the current Git branch (`main`).
*   `$ cd hello_world`: This is a command to change the current directory to "hello\_world".
*   `hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~/hello_world (main)`: The shell prompt after changing the directory.

*   `bash: $'\E[200~1s': command not found`: This indicates that the previous command was not recognized by the shell. It seems like there was an issue with the input, possibly due to copy-pasting or incorrect character encoding.
*   `$`: A new shell prompt.
*   `$ ls -l Dockerfile`: This is a command to list the Dockerfile with detailed information.
*   `-rw-r--r-- 1 hsent 197609 343 Feb 16 18:50 Dockerfile`: This is the output of the `ls -l` command. It shows the file permissions, number of hard links, owner, group, file size (197609 bytes), last modification date and time (Feb 16 18:50), and the filename (Dockerfile).
