If we use ngrok to create a tunnel to our API or Llamafile server, for how long should our terminal remain running? Should it be active only at the time of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is completed?

Is it like only the questions from the portal will be sent to the api?

If yes, is this project just about finding which question is asked and accordingly match the answer send the answer as response?

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a UI element, likely from a web application or platform, related to deploying an application. It consists of a title, a horizontal line, and a descriptive paragraph.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Title:** "Deploy your application"
*   **Description:** "Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel."

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The content suggests that the user is being guided through the process of deploying their application to a publicly accessible URL. The text emphasizes that any platform can be used for deployment, and specifically mentions "Vercel" as an example. This implies that the user is on a platform that supports application deployment, and the text is providing instructions or encouragement to proceed.

**4. Technical details:**

There are no technical details visible in the image. It is purely a UI element with text content.

Hello Sir,

I understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as well? I believe both serve the same purpose. Wanted to know your thoughts on the same sir.

Thanks and Regards

Shalini

Any question from first 5 Ga‚Äôs can be there and you would need to analyze which question it is, you can use function calling or prompting as well. Function calling is better approach here.

Hi @24f2006531

You can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer)

Kind regards

Then it comes down to what the project demands, as in what kind of questions the llm will be tested on (like you said). Hope the team can give us a test set like in the first project.

There are a total of 57 questions in all 5 GAs(18+10+9+10+10).

Due to so many different formats of accepting questions and solving them, my main question is:

Is the main essence of this project related to deciphering cryptic js code in order to scrape it?

Some other doubts are

Some questions ask for you to access some hidden divs in the html page and use that for solving (like week 1 q11)
Some questions ask you for AIPROXY TOKENs (like week 3 q9)
Some questions required manual correction to get correct answers (like week 4 q2)
Some questions require file output (like week 2 q2)

How do we account for this? @Jivraj @s.anand @carlton

I have few questions just going through the Project 2 problem statement.

Are we supposed to use OpenAI api‚Äôs or locally/private hosted one?
Many of the questions need files or images or audio files as input, same api is expected to handle those also?
Can we work in a team and submit the project together?
If we are to use locally hosted llm system, our systems are not strong enough to run most of the good ones locally
Is it possible to get a TA to collaborate in our project as an observer?

awaiting a response.

Thank you‚Ä¶

@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

Dear Sir,

I have few questions. It is written in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-2) that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don‚Äôt think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.

In GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI `gh`  which we have to install in the vercel instance using `apt` package manager.

But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.
In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?

Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install `ngrok` package.
In GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requires `docker` package installed.
In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?
Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?
And many more

Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.

Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.

Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation.

I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.

Also, some ques requires external toolings like

In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.
In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?
GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can‚Äôt be installed locally.

How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.

Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like

In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or  Data URI.
Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used ‚ÄúSave as‚Äù to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?

Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from [https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev) will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.

Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.

If you are talking about the parameters of those questions, then it would be better if you make your API capable of working with different parameters.

Well if your API is capable of solving those questions in your GAs with the expected answer, then that‚Äôs sufficient validation.

If you are indicating towards working collaboratively then,

Yes, we encourage you to collaborate with others and collectively work towards solving this project. Even if you are going for the relatively easiest approach of Function Calling, it would require you to code about 50 functions to solve all your tasks. Which is why it is sensible to work collectively.

Hello Sir,

I have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.

Currently answers that we have entered for GA‚Äôs 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we‚Äôve entered as well for verification purposes.

The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.

Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?

How do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.

Thanks and Regards

Shalini

What does it mean to solve the question?

Everyone is asking that?

Do you yourself know what to do and to go about it?

Or just pull out something from your hAtSS at the last moment?

‚Äúand responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.‚Äù

From my understanding only those questions that are solved with a program and give an answer are to be considered‚Ä¶ For example it states in the project that  :backhand_index_pointing_down:t3: 

" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:"

If you all still have not responded, then I‚Äôm honestly not sure if this is what y‚Äôall meant.

Last project was not clear to some extent, This time its even more vague.

I understand that y‚Äôall want to give different projects to help High Order Thinking skills, but if not executed properly, no one actually learns anything and we(I) just end by debugging the project statement code and question with no relevance to the project. If we wanted to do that, I could just go random GitHub repos and solve and create pull requests for a specific bug. Also we end up losing interest thinking most if the course instructors don‚Äôt what they are doing. I understand Anand Sir is extremely busy(like really busy lol), but what are the course instructors doing?

I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.

Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I‚Äôm curious about your preference.

Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.

Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll spend most of your time, so make sure you‚Äôre comfortable with it.

Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you‚Äôll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.

To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:

Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)
Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)
Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)
Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)
Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)
Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)
Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)
Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)

AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor

Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer‚Äôs toolkit. Please make sure to use them.

To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type `code -s`, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.

What is the output of `code -s`? The output of `code -s` cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user‚Äôs system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.

As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**1. UI Elements:**

*   **Heading:** "IIT Madras Assignment Helper"
*   **Introductory Text:** "Welcome to the Assignment Helper! This tool helps you find answers to IIT Madras Data Science graded assignment questions."
*   **Section Heading:** "Ask a Question"
*   **Text Area:** A text area where a question can be entered. It contains a pre-filled question.
*   **File Upload:** A file upload field labeled "Upload assignment file (optional):" with a "Choose File" button and "No file chosen" text.
*   **Button:** A green button labeled "Get Answer".
*   **Section Heading:** "Answer:"
*   **Text Area:** A text area displaying the answer to the question.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Question (in the text area):**
    "or high-performing posts.
    Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-16T06:36:30.367Z with at least 1 comment with 5 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called post\_id, and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.
    Check the console for the result of your query."
*   **Answer (in the text area):**
    "sql SELECT post\_id FROM social\_media WHERE timestamp >= 2025-01-16T06:36:30.367Z AND EXISTS(
    SELECT 1 FROM json\_each(comments) WHERE json\_extract(value, $.stars.useful)::INT > 5 ) ORDER BY post\_id;"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows a UI for an "IIT Madras Assignment Helper" tool. The tool appears to be designed to help students with IIT Madras Data Science assignments. Users can input a question (presumably related to the assignment) and optionally upload an assignment file. The tool then provides an answer, likely generated based on the question and/or the uploaded file.

**4. Technical Details (Code Screenshot):**

*   The question asks for a DuckDB SQL query. DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP database management system

and this is also working with simple question

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a command-line interface (CLI) or terminal window. It displays a `curl` command and its output.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   `D:\Yantravid>`: This indicates the current directory in the command prompt.
*   `curl -X POST "https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/" -F "question=what is 2+2?"`: This is the `curl` command being executed.
*   `{"answer":"4"}`: This is the JSON response received from the `curl` command.
*   `D:\Yantravid>`: This is the command prompt after the command has been executed.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows a `curl` command being used to send a POST request to a Vercel app endpoint. The request includes a form field named "question" with the value "what is 2+2?". The server responds with a JSON object containing the key "answer" and the value "4". This suggests the Vercel app is designed to answer questions.

**4. Technical details:**

*   `curl`: A command-line tool used to transfer data with URLs.
*   `-X POST`: Specifies that the HTTP method used should be POST.
*   `"https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/"`: The URL of the API endpoint being called. It appears to be a Vercel deployment.
*   `-F "question=what is 2+2?"`:  Specifies a form field named "question" with the value "what is 2+2?" to be sent in the POST request.
*   `{"answer":"4"}`: The JSON response from the server, indicating the answer to the question.

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal window, likely a command-line interface (CLI) on a Windows system. It displays a `curl` command being executed, followed by the server's response in JSON format.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Command:**
    ```
    D:\Yantravid\yantravid>curl -X POST "https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/" ^
    More? -F "question=Download qmove.zip and extract it. Use mv to move all files under folders into an empty folder. Then rename all file
    s replacing each digit with the next. 1 becomes 2, 9 becomes 0, a1b9c.txt becomes a2b0c.txt. What does running grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort |
    sha256sum in bash on that folder show?" ^
    More? -F "file=@D:\Yantravid\yantravid\test_data\qmove.zip"
    ```
*   **Response:**
    ```json
    {"answer":"text\ne086115d65479e8562262a61e17e4568880561732b2d6e81117e041681883191"}
    ```

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows an interaction with a web API. The `curl` command is sending a POST request to a Vercel-hosted API endpoint. The request includes two form fields:

*   `question`: This field contains a complex instruction set, essentially asking the API to perform a series of file manipulation tasks on a downloaded ZIP file.
*   `file`: This field specifies the path to a ZIP file (`qmove.zip`) that is being uploaded as part of the request.

The API's response is a JSON object containing an "answer" field. The value of the "answer" field appears to be a string that starts with "text"

Sir, for GA-5 question number 3 the file is too large to send via request to vercel

possible solution is uploading on google drive or smth like that but how will u guys send such long files plus the project only mention sending files not url ‚Ä¶Kindly clarify regarding this.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows text content, likely from a documentation page or tutorial, explaining how to interact with an API endpoint. The text is displayed against a dark gray background.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The text content is as follows:

*   "Your application exposes an API endpoint. Let's assume that it is at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`."
*   "The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/` with the question as well as optional file attachments as multipart/form-data."

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The text provides instructions on how to use an API endpoint. It specifies the URL of the endpoint and the HTTP method (POST) that should be used to interact with it. It also mentions that the endpoint accepts a question as input and can handle optional file attachments using the `multipart/form-data` format.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **API Endpoint:** The example API endpoint is `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`. This suggests the application is hosted on Vercel.
*   **HTTP Method:** The endpoint requires a `POST` request.
*   **Data Format:** The endpoint accepts a question as part of the request and can handle file uploads using the `multipart/form-data` encoding. This is a standard way to send files along with other data in an HTTP request.

Here, the questions entered after the endpoint will be exactly same as the GAs or be similar as the GAs ??

My Approach , is to

scrape and parse all the current question
create embeddings ,  of the questions.
create a test endpoint , just to check if i am able to correctly identify the questions
segregate numerical , string and json responses and see if these can be answered part of phase 1
Phase 2 , experiment with url based answers. need to see if an MCP server can come in handy

to deploy a server and return an url

Since the token is limited, I have thought to use the run llms locally,  to check for the accuracy of solving the question.

I want to know which LLM will be more closer to the one used for evaluating our project.
Does the model used for evaluation is capable for handling raw files, or we need to pass it in the text format..(As as I am to recall, the models are capable enough to handle the files..)

Thanks!

Does anyone willing to work with me..?

Should we answer the questions and return the response to enter in the answer box(as stated in the question) or should we just provide instructions on how to go about solving the question? Some of the questions include pictures and we cannot use LLM for pictures.

They(instructors) only don‚Äôt what to do it looks like, Anand Sir will tell them and they will tell you (with 25-50 percent lossy communication), just wait and keeping tagging Anand Sir. He will explain clearly, Ask everyone to push for a live session with Anand Sir , that 40 mins he explains will be worth its weight in gold, Hope he does that.

should we make the functions on the basis of the GAs or should we make it general so it will be able to perform the task but the data provided will be different.

The key learning objective for Project 2 is for you to be absolutely comfortable interacting with APIs and understanding how they work to perform tasks.

So there is very little need for the use of LLMs or agents.

Identify the the question being asked (how you do this is upto you, you can be as simplistic as using regex to look for some key words, or you can be clever and create embeddings out of the original question and calculate the similarity from the request)
Create a function that solves the question with the required parameters and inputs. Remember this does not have to be fancy. Just compute the answer. You do not need to do the task as the GA required. You ONLY want the answer. No tools required. Just a computed answer.
Give the answer back as specified.

Kind regards

carlton:

You do not need to do the task as the GA required.

Does this mean this type of question won‚Äôt be paramaterized?

**Image: Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 5.17.35 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows text, likely from a tutorial or documentation, instructing the user on how to use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from the command line. It also poses a question about the output of a specific command.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   "Install and run Visual Studio Code. In your Terminal (or Command Prompt), type `code -s` and press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below."
*   "What is the output of `code -s`?"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The context is likely a tutorial or guide on using VS Code from the command line. The purpose is to instruct the user to execute the command `code -s` in their terminal and then copy the output. The question at the end suggests that the user is expected to understand or analyze the output of this command.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

*   `code` is the command-line tool for VS Code.
*   `-s` is likely a flag or option passed to the `code` command. Without further context, it's difficult to know the exact function of the `-s` flag, but it likely relates to some form of status, settings, or server-related information.

Like instead of `code -s` there won‚Äôt be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won‚Äôt be part of evaluation at all?

The same confusion is for these type of questions as well:

**Image: Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 5.43.34 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows two separate sections of what appears to be an online assessment or tutorial related to spreadsheet formulas. Each section presents a formula and asks the user to determine the result. There are input fields for the user to enter their answer and "Check" buttons to submit their response.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Section 1 (Google Sheets):**
    *   "Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel)"
    *   `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6), 1, 10))`
    *   "What is the result?"
    *   "Check"

*   **Section 2 (Excel):**
    *   "Use Excel (0.25 marks)"
    *   "Let's make sure you can write formulas in Excel. Type this formula into Excel."
    *   "Note: This will ONLY work in Office 365."
    *   `=SUM(TAKE(SORTBY({3,14,6,10,3,12,9,6,3,12,15,4,11,11,4,14}, {10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12}), 1, 9))`
    *   "What is the result?"
    *   "Note: If you get #NAME? you have the wrong version of Excel. Find a friend for whom this works."
    *   "Check"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image is likely part of an online course, quiz, or tutorial designed to test the user's understanding of spreadsheet formulas in Google Sheets and Excel. The purpose is to have the user evaluate the given formulas and predict their output. The instructions emphasize the specific software (Google Sheets or Excel) and version compatibility (Office 365).

**4. Technical Details (Formulas):**

*   **Google Sheets Formula:**
    *   

A bit more clarity would be helpful. Thanks in advance.

there will not be any other command. This question can be solved with a hardcoded answer

Excel and Google sheet questions can be solved by just using python . No excel or google sheets required.

The question WILL be parameterised however. So the numbers might be different. You should just understand what the question is asking and solve it programatically to get the answer.

I am not sure how you came to that conclusion!

For example vercel question still requires a vercel endpoint that will respond.

What I said is some questions might not need you to use those specific tools. Your answers should still be legitimate answers that one can paste into the text box of a GA and still get it correct.

The only question that will not be asked is the LLM say yes question.

A github account would still need you to commit a file to it and provide the url that is reachable.

etc.

my small piece of code to evaluate the GA number parsing, it may be useful for some

import httpx, os
import json
import logging
import random

async def run(task: str):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=30) as client:
        logging.warning(f"üü° Running task: {task.strip()}")

Hi TAs,

I attended the meet which happened today. But I don‚Äôt clearly get one thing.

Most of the questions have a **question text** and a **file: csv,zip,json,etc**

My doubt is, will the request to the end point be :

curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/stats/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting"

my doubt :

Is this the only format or can there be other too ?

Hi @23f2000573

Yes this is correct format for the question, It will have 2 fields question and file.

You can send a file from local machine like this  `-F "file=@abcd.zip"` so here `abcd.zip` must be in current working directory.

Kind regards

Fine sir, this is clear. I have a few doubts in the file formats. When free, kindly address these to. I will try to cover most common doubts, so that you wouldn‚Äôt need to answer similar doubts again. Sorry if some of the doubts are basic / written incorrectly.

FILES

The data file sent to the api will always be in the **requester‚Äôs** local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format?

Or

Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this :  [https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png)

This link was take from GA2 Question 2

HTML AND TABLE

Some questions have `html` and `tables`. In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string.

Example for string. Consider the table

Col 1
Col 2

Row 1, Col1
Row 1 Col 2

Row 2, Col 1
Row 2 Col 2

Will this be something like this

"|Col 1| Col 2|\n|-|-|\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|"

or something like

"<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Col 1</th>\n<th>Col 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>
"

HIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS

In one question, there were two tasks.

Find the answer to the question
Enable the `disabled` text block

In this question, what will the answer type be?

Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block

MORE THAN ONE FILE

Some questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link [https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp) and a table.

In this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this

curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file= Image file" \
  -F "file= table file/ string" 

CORS HEADERS

Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?

Hi,

In GA 2, q5, this is the code i got in the question.

import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from google.colab import files
import colorsys

# There is a mistake in the line below. Fix it
image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys)[0])

rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0
lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)
light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.554)
print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.554: {light_pixels}')

Is this the code for others as well?

Thanks

So I was thinking to create the project 2 together and I was looking for collaboration, and for that we would require the following:

 ‚Üí the set of question-answers pairs at first

 ‚Üí All the questions of 2 distinct students to see which parameters changes in each questions

 ‚Üí Make the solution functional and parameterised based on previous step.

Till now I have created the following:

 ‚Üí Identification of the question, using embeddings

 ‚Üí extraction of parameters using llm for that particular question

 ‚Üí Implementation of 3 questions using this approach

If we come together, we all can reduce the workload and complete it on time.

*Those who resonate with my approach or have any different approach feel free to leave a DM. I might not respond immediately as I might not be online all the time  :slight_smile:

Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this : [https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png)

file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.

 23f2000573:

"<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Col 1</th>\n<th>Col 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>

This is correct html table format.

 23f2000573:

Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block

It will be just answer.

 23f2000573:

  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file= Image file" \
  -F "file= table file/ string" 

In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.

 23f2000573:

Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?

I didn‚Äôt get this question, could you point to exact question?

Sir, a few things are not yet clear .

 Jivraj:

file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.

Some questions have **clickable html buttons**. When we click that, the zipfile or json file, or csv gets downloaded

Some questions have **image attached to the text**. For this, we have to use **right click ‚Üí download the image**. Here, the image is take from some url. For example. in GA2, q2, the image displayed is taken from [https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png).

My doubt is, what will be the value of file attribute in curl command

Will it be

‚Äúfile=binary of zipfile/csv/json‚Äù for the first type and
‚Äúfile=[https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png)‚Äù for the second type

 Jivraj:

This is correct html table format.

Will this table be in the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù attribute of curl or ‚Äúfile‚Äù attribute

 Jivraj:

In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.

so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù attribute and the image in the ‚Äúfile‚Äù attribute?

Hi @23f2000573

 23f2000573:

Will it be

‚Äúfile=binary of zipfile/csv/json‚Äù for the first type and
‚Äúfile=[https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png‚Äù](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png%E2%80%9D) for the second type

Files will be exactly same as GA assignment, if there is url then it will be a url and if it get‚Äôs downloaded by clicking then it will come from requester‚Äôs machine.

 23f2000573:

so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù attribute and the image in the ‚Äúfile‚Äù attribute?

For questions that have table they will either come as html code or as markdown. Keep a if else condition for identifying which case it is, if it‚Äôs a html then beautiful soup should be able to find table tag, if it‚Äôs markdown table then it can be identified with `|` characters.

Kind regards

For GA 1, question 2

**Image: Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 4.17.09 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface element, likely part of an online coding exercise or interactive tutorial. It presents a task involving sending an HTTPS request and analyzing the JSON output. There's a code snippet, a question prompt, and a "Check" button.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Instructions:**
    *   "Running `uv run --with httpie -- https [URL]` installs the Python package `httpie` and sends a HTTPS request to the URL."
    *   "Send a HTTPS request to `https://httpbin.org/get` with the URL encoded parameter `email` set to `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`"
    *   "What is the JSON output of the command? (Paste only the JSON body, not the headers)"
*   **JSON Output (Partial):**
    *   `{ "args": { "email": "21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" }, "headers": { "Accept": "*/*", "Accept-Encodir`
*   **Button:**
    *   "Check"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The context is likely a coding challenge or exercise where the user needs to use the `httpie` command-line tool to send an HTTPS request to a specified URL (`https://httpbin.org/get`). The request includes a URL-encoded parameter named "email" with a specific email address as its value. The user is then asked to provide the JSON output of the command, specifically the JSON body and not the headers. The "Check" button suggests that the user's answer will be validated.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **`httpie`:** This is a command-line HTTP client. It's used to send HTTP requests from the terminal.
*   **`https://httpbin.org/get`:** This is a URL that's part of the `httpbin.org` service. It's designed to echo back the details of the HTTP request it receives, including the URL parameters and headers.
*   **URL-encoded parameter:**

The portal accept answers in strict json with double quotes. Now in the project we need to return the answer in string value which again has double quotes, so the best answer I could get is using `\"` inside the answer like this.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 4.25.02 PM**
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

1.  **UI Elements:** The image shows a snippet of code or data displayed in a text editor or terminal. The background is dark, suggesting a dark theme. There's a cursor visible on the right edge.

2.  **Text Content:** The visible text appears to be a JSON-like structure. Here's a breakdown:

    *   `"answer":` This is the key for the main data structure.
    *   `"{\"args\":`  Indicates a nested object with arguments.
    *   `{\"email\": \"21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\"}`:  This suggests an email address is being passed as an argument. The email is `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
    *   `"headers\":` Indicates a nested object containing HTTP headers.
    *   `{\"Accept\": \"*/*\", \"Accept-Encoding\":`:  Shows the "Accept" header is set to accept all content types (`*/*`). The "Accept-Encoding" header is also present.
    *   `doflato)" \ "Hoct\", \"httphin ord)"`: This part is incomplete and possibly truncated, but it seems to be related to the "Accept-Encoding" header and possibly other headers like "Host" and "HTTP".

3.  **Context/Purpose:** The data likely represents a response from a server or an API endpoint. It seems to be capturing information about a request, including arguments passed and the headers sent with the request. This is often used for debugging or logging purposes.

4.  **Technical Details:**
    *   The data is formatted as a JSON-like string, but it appears to be escaped (e.g., `{\"email\": ...}`). This means it's likely a string representation of a JSON object, rather than a directly parsed JSON object.
    *   The presence of "Accept" and "Accept-Encoding" headers suggests this is related to an HTTP request.
    *   The email address `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` indicates a student at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).

But still the GA portal marks it as invalid json. What to do in this case?

Hi @21f2000709

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a code snippet, likely from an interactive Python environment like Jupyter Notebook or IPython. It demonstrates how to work with JSON data. The code shows the creation of a string that represents a JSON object, parsing it into a Python dictionary using `json.loads()`, and accessing a specific value within the dictionary.

**2. Text Content:**

Here's a breakdown of the text in each line:

*   **In [28]:** `jobj`
    **Out[28]:** `"{'name':'jivraj'}"`
*   **In [29]:** `jobj = '{"name":"jivraj"}'`
*   **In [30]:** `jobj`
    **Out[30]:** `'{"name":"jivraj"}'`
*   **In [31]:** `json.loads(jobj)`
    **Out[31]:** `{'name': 'jivraj'}`
*   **In [32]:** `json.loads(jobj)['name']`
    **Out[32]:** `'jivraj'`
*   **In [33]:** `type(jobj)`
    **Out[33]:** `str`
*   **In [34]:** `|` (This indicates an active input line)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The code aims to illustrate the following:

*   **JSON String Representation:**  A JSON object is initially represented as a string.
*   **String Assignment:** The code assigns a string containing JSON data to the variable `jobj`.
*   **JSON Parsing:** The `json.loads()` function from the `json` module is used to parse the JSON string into a Python dictionary.
*   **Dictionary Access:** The code demonstrates how to access a specific value within the parsed dictionary using its key (in this case, 'name').
*   **Data Type:** The `type()` function confirms that `jobj` is a string.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **`json.loads()`:** This function is crucial for converting a JSON-formatted string into a Python dictionary.  Without this conversion, you can't directly access the data within the JSON structure using dictionary

This works, just send a string which can be loaded as json object.

The correct answer has to be with the escape sequence otherwise you cannot send a valid response back.

We never feed your response to the GA by copy pasting.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 5.28.12 pm.png**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a code snippet, likely from a Python script, along with the output of running that script. The code involves creating a dictionary, converting it to a JSON string, parsing the JSON string, and extracting a specific value. The output shows the results of these operations, as well as a final print statement.

**2. Text Content:**

Here's a breakdown of the text content:

*   **Code:**
    *   `response = { "answer": '{ \"args\":{\"challenge\": \"How can TDS ever hope to solve this problem?\" } }' }`
    *   `import json`
    *   `send_response = json.dumps(response, indent=2)`
    *   `print (send_response)`
    *   `tds_evaluator = json.loads(send_response)['answer']`
    *   `print (tds_evaluator)`
    *   `print ("OH MY GOODNESS! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! THIS IS AMAZING!")`
*   **Output:**
    *   `{ "answer": "{ \"args\":{\"challenge\": \"How can TDS ever hope to solve this problem?\" } }" }`
    *   `{ "args": {"challenge": "How can TDS ever hope to solve this problem?" } }`
    *   `OH MY GOODNESS! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! THIS IS AMAZING!`
*   **Timestamps:**
    *   `0.0s` (appears multiple times, likely indicating execution time)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The code appears to be demonstrating how to work with JSON data in Python. It creates a dictionary with a nested structure, converts it to a JSON string using `json.dumps`, and then parses the JSON string back into a Python dictionary using `json.loads`. The code then extracts a specific value from the parsed dictionary. The final print statement suggests that the result of these operations is considered successful or surprising.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **JSON:** The code uses the `json` library to serialize and deserialize Python dictionaries to and from JSON strings.
*   **`json.dumps()`:** This function converts a Python dictionary into a

So the questions expecting JSON will be jsonified separately before passing to the evaluator because in the current implementation in the text field idk why it is failing to load the json with `\"` however I could load the exact thing using json.loads in python.

**Image: 1000145015**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image is a screenshot of a webpage, likely a tutorial or assignment instruction. It contains text, a code snippet, a form field, and a button. At the top, there's a screenshot of what appears to be a GitHub Codespaces interface.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Title:** "TDS 2025 Ja..." (likely a course or project name)
*   **URL:** "anand.workers.dev" (the domain of the webpage)
*   **Instructions:**
    *   "Publish a page using GitHub Pages that showcases your work. Ensure that your email address 22f3000819@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is in the page's HTML."
    *   "GitHub pages are served via CloudFlare which obfuscates emails. So, wrap your email address inside a:"
    *   "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/"
    *   "If a recent change that's not reflected, add ?v=1, ?v=2 to the URL to bust the cache."
    *   "Use Google Colab (0.5 marks)"

*   **Code Snippet:**
    *   `22f3000819@ds.study.i`

*   **Button:** "Check"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The webpage provides instructions for publishing a webpage using GitHub Pages. It emphasizes the importance of including a specific email address in the HTML and provides a method to obfuscate it to prevent scraping. It also asks the user to input the GitHub Pages URL and suggests a method to bust the cache if changes aren't reflected. The "Use Google Colab (0.5 marks)" suggests that the task is part of an assignment or evaluation.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **GitHub Pages:** The instructions revolve around using GitHub Pages, a service that allows users to host websites directly from a GitHub repository.
*   **Email Obfuscation:** The code snippet `22f3000819@ds.study.i` demonstrates a simple

For questions like this (there‚Äôs a similar one in GA1 too, will the user send the USER and REPO of their GitHub account as parameters too?

Even if they do, my script may not get necessary authentication to create repo and make commit in their repository. In this case, would I have to implement GitHub OAuth flow?

If they don‚Äôt send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.

Can you please at least hint at a solution?

Edit: Same query for the GitHub actions question (GA2 Q7)

Another edit: A similar query for GA2 Q8. Repeated dockerimage pushes to Dockerhub with different tags.

Use the following script to enable answer boxes and check answers buttons:

inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons  = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));

For GA-1 question 10,

we need to get the hash of the json, from the site [JSON Hash](https://tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash),

I found that underneath it using sha-256 in a function inside the encrypt.js file but still when I implemented the same in python, it is giving a different hash. Can we get the hashing code in python?

You won‚Äôt be required to update someone else‚Äôs repo.

Any github name, repo name is fine.

Just that it should have github pages with that particular email address.

Same for GA2 Quetion7 as well, you github url is required.

In evaluation we will only send request one worst case twice or thrice if it fails from our end, so no issues with that.

@carlton and @jivraj,

Hello.. I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn‚Äôt even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..

I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don‚Äôt have those answers). Thank you.

I too want to know like by 5 questions at random, is it 1 random question per GA or 5 random questions from the entire 5 GAs?

In the later case, there would be no certainty unless all of our questions works and there aren‚Äôt any unexpected surprises at the evaluation.

in the GA 4 question 5 ( Find the bounding box of a city ) Will the OSM_id ending digits be provided. In the question body they are not there but on submission they come like in the attached screenshot.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a section of a user interface, likely from a web application or a similar system. It includes a title, descriptive text, a list of benefits, a question, an input field, and an error message.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Title:** "Impact"
*   **Introductory Text:** "By automating the extraction and processing of bounding box data, UrbanRide can:"
*   **List of Benefits:**
    *   "Optimize Routing: Enhance route planning algorithms with precise geographical boundaries, reducing delivery times and operational costs."
    *   "Improve Fleet Allocation: Allocate vehicles more effectively across defined service zones based on accurate city extents."
    *   "Enhance Market Analysis: Gain deeper insights into regional performance, enabling targeted marketing and service improvements."
    *   "Scale Operations: Seamlessly integrate new cities into their service network with minimal manual intervention, ensuring consistent data quality."
*   **Question:** "What is the minimum latitude of the bounding box of the city Tianjin in the country China on the Nominatim API? Value of the minimum latitude"
*   **Input Field Value:** "38.566"
*   **Error Message:** "Error: Incorrect latitude. Check OSM ID ending with 2077"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image appears to be part of a system that uses geographical data, specifically bounding boxes of cities. The "UrbanRide" mentioned likely refers to a transportation or logistics company. The system is designed to automate the extraction and processing of this data to improve various aspects of their operations.

The user is being asked to provide the minimum latitude of the bounding box for the city of Tianjin, China, using data from the Nominatim API (a geocoding service). The user has entered "38.566", but the system has flagged this as incorrect, suggesting the user should check the OpenStreetMap (OSM) ID ending with 2077.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **Bounding Box:** A bounding box is a rectangular area defined by its minimum and maximum latitude and longitude. It's a common way to represent the geographical extent of a place.
*   **Nominatim API:** A popular open-source geocoding service that can be

I faced the same issue. Initially, I used `geopy.geocoders` to solve the question, and it provided the correct answer during the assignment submission. However, the same approach is now giving an incorrect result.

Instead of using `geopy`, try using this URL directly: [https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search) .

This worked for me.

I have a doubt like when I pass answers in string and in the questions about markdown will the \n characters be properly parsed before checking the correctness of the markdown or will it be directly checked for valid markdown? Because the raw string when pasted in the text box of the GA isn‚Äôt getting the markdown.

In case of image compression question, should I return the base64 encoding of the compressed image?

**Respected TDS Team,**

I currently have Three doubts regarding **Project 2**:

As per the 19th March session, it was mentioned that the files would be the same for everyone, and only the parameters in the questions would vary. However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I‚Äôm attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1‚Äîone is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate.

**Image: mydata**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a table, likely from a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. The table contains sales transaction data. The table has a header row and multiple data rows. The background color of the table is light green.

**2. Text Content:**

The table has the following columns and data:

*   **TransactionID:** 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004, 0005, 0006, 0007, 0008, 0009, 0010, 0011, 0012, 0013, 0014
*   **Customer Name:** John Doe, Frank Thomas, Bob Brown, Bob Brown, Charlie Davis, Charlie Davis, Bob Brown, John Doe, Alice Johnson, Eve Wilson, Charlie Davis, Frank Thomas, Eve Wilson, Bob Brown
*   **Country:** France, United States, FRA, IND, United Arab Emirates, US, AE, United States, U.A.E, United Kingdom, AE, FR, FRA, UAE
*   **Date:** 10-13-2023, 2022/10/14, 09-06-2023, 01-27-2022, 09-26-2022, 2022/05/25, 2023/09/20, 2022/09/06, 01-11-2022, 2022/07/13, 03-30-2022, 01-16-2022, 08-10-2022, 05-29-2023
*   **Product/Code:** Eta/fzflrq, Alpha/f2yscp, Theta/xvwf8u, Zeta/4rk2rx, Theta/0ylj7e, Kappa/bquhwf, Iota/0t6cym, Gamma/mb

**Image: friend data**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a table of data, likely exported from a database or spreadsheet. The table contains information about transactions, including customer details, product codes, sales figures, and costs.

**2. Text Content:**

The table has the following column headers:

*   **TransactionID:** A unique identifier for each transaction (e.g., 0001, 0002, etc.)
*   **Customer Name:** The name of the customer involved in the transaction (e.g., Frank Thomas, Eve Wilson, Jane Smith, John Doe, Alice Johnson, Bob Brown, Charlie Davis)
*   **Country:** The country of the customer (e.g., IND, US, United Kingdom, Fra, AE, U.S.A, U.K, Bra)
*   **Date:** The date of the transaction (in various formats, e.g., 12-01-2022, 08-10-2023, 2022/09/04, etc.)
*   **Product/Code:** The product code associated with the transaction (e.g., Delta/tbakf3, Alpha/hknae9, Theta/mjrd4g, etc.)
*   **Sales:** The sales amount for the transaction, followed by "USD" (e.g., 7164 USD, 2457 USD, etc.)
*   **Cost:** The cost associated with the transaction, followed by "USD" (e.g., 2062 USD, 3439 USD, etc.)

The table contains 17 rows of data, each representing a different transaction.

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The table appears to be a record of sales transactions. It provides a structured view of sales data, allowing for analysis of sales performance, customer behavior, product popularity, and cost management. It could be used for reporting, business intelligence, or data analysis purposes.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The data is presented in a tabular format, suggesting it originates from a database, spreadsheet, or data analysis tool.
*   The "Product/Code" column contains strings that likely represent unique product identifiers.
*   The "

During the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.

In **GA4 Q2**, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages‚ÄîSpanish, Dutch, I believe.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) element, likely from a web application or testing environment. It displays a question, a JSON data snippet, an error message, some informational text, and a "Check" button.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Question:** "What is the JSON data?"
*   **JSON Data:**
    ```json
    {
        "id": "tt30422937",
        "title": "6. Nadaaniyan",
        "year": "2025",
        "rating": "3.0"
    }
    ```
*   **Error Message:** "Error: At \[5].title: Values don't match. Expected: "6. Naadaniyaan". Actual: "6. Nadaaniyan""
*   **Informational Text:** "IMDb search results may differ by region. You may need to manually translate titles. Results may also change periodically. You may need to re-run your scraper code."
*   **Button:** "Check"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The UI appears to be part of a system that validates or tests data retrieved from IMDb (Internet Movie Database). The user is presented with a JSON data structure, and the system is checking if the "title" field matches an expected value. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual title values. The informational text suggests that IMDb data can vary by region and may require manual translation or periodic updates to the scraper code.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **JSON:** The JSON data represents information about a movie or TV show, including its IMDb ID, title, year of release, and rating.
*   **Error Message:** The error message indicates a data validation failure. The system expected the "title" field to be "6. Naadaniyaan", but it found "6. Nadaaniyan". This suggests a potential typo or encoding issue.
*   **Scraper Code:** The informational text mentions "scraper code," implying that the data is being automatically extracted from IMDb using a web scraping tool. The suggestion to re-run the scraper code indicates that the data source might have changed.
*   **UI Elements:** The "Check" button suggests that

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a section of a user interface, likely from a streaming service or movie/TV show database. It displays information about two different TV shows or movies. Each entry includes:

*   A thumbnail image of the show/movie poster.
*   The title of the show/movie.
*   Additional details like release year, duration, and rating.
*   A short synopsis or description of the plot.

**2. Text Content:**

*   "An FBI agent and Florida State officer team up to investigate a string of unsolved murder cases." (This is likely a description of a show above the visible section.)
*   "6. Nadaaniyan" (Title of a show/movie)
*   "2025" (Release year)
*   "1h 59m" (Duration)
*   "TV-14" (Rating)
*   "3.0 (14K)" (Rating and number of ratings)
*   "Rate" (A button or link to rate the show/movie)
*   "A privileged Delhi socialite hires a middle-class student to pose as her boyfriend to maintain her social status. Their pretense becomes complicated when genuine feelings develop between them." (Synopsis of "Nadaaniyan")
*   "7. Watson" (Title of another show/movie)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The purpose of this UI is to present a list of TV shows or movies to a user, allowing them to browse and find something to watch. The information provided helps the user decide if they are interested in a particular show/movie.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The UI uses a list format to display the entries.
*   There are "+" icons on the top left corner of the thumbnails, likely indicating an option to add the show to a watchlist or similar feature.
*   There is an information icon (a circle with an "i" inside) next to the "Nadaaniyan" entry, which probably leads to more detailed information about the show.
*   The rating is displayed as a star followed by a numerical value and the number of ratings.
*   The text is formatted with different font sizes and styles to highlight important information.

Please check the issue in the images provided. How to handle this question.

In **GA4 Q10**, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, @carlton sir had mentioned that the question would be revised.

Here is the [thread link](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/106) for reference.

How should we handle this question now?

Thankyou

**Image: sad me**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a close-up of a man's face. It appears to be a still frame or a low-resolution image.

**2. Any text content visible:**

There is no text visible in the image.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image appears to be a portrait or a reaction shot of a man. Without further context, it's difficult to determine the exact purpose.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The image quality is somewhat low, suggesting it might be a screenshot or a compressed image.
*   The man has dark hair and a mustache.
*   He is wearing a white shirt and what appears to be a dark suit jacket.
*   The background is blurry and indistinct.

Based on the facial features and the style of the image, the man in the image is likely Will Smith. The image may be a still from one of his movies or television appearances.

Hi @23f2003751

Short Answer: No
Long Answer:

Backslashes are usually not a problem when converting a string to JSON. But somehow the evaluation script isn‚Äôt taking this into consideration. Check this out.

This is my response

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a user interface element, likely from a coding or educational application. It shows a "Sorted JSON" output, presented within a rounded-corner box. The box contains a JSON array of objects. There's also a green checkmark and the word "Correct" below the box.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **"Sorted JSON:"** - This is the title or label indicating the content being displayed.
*   **JSON data:**
    *   `[{ "name": "Bob", "age": 11 }, { "name": "Emma", "age": 11 }, { "name": "Grace", "age": 14 }, { "na`
*   **"Correct"** - This indicates that the displayed JSON is the expected or correct output.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image likely represents a coding exercise or a validation step in a software application. The user is presented with a JSON array that is supposed to be sorted in a specific way. The "Correct" label and the checkmark suggest that the displayed JSON is the correct sorted output.

**4. Technical details (JSON):**

The JSON data consists of an array of objects. Each object represents a person with "name" and "age" properties. The data appears to be sorted alphabetically by name. The last object is incomplete, only containing "na".

which is shown incorrect just after adding 2 backslashes

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface element displaying a JSON array. The array contains objects with "name" and "age" properties. The display is highlighted with a red border, indicating an error. Below the JSON, there's an error message.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **"Sorted JSON:"** - This is a label indicating that the JSON data is sorted.
*   **JSON Array:**
    *   `[{ "name": "Bob", "age": 11 }, { "name": "Emma", "age": 11 }, { "name": "Grace", "age": 14 }, { "r`
*   **"SyntaxError: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 16 (line 1 column 17)"** - This is an error message indicating a syntax error in the JSON.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image likely represents a JSON validator or editor where the user has entered JSON data. The system has detected a syntax error in the JSON and is displaying an error message to help the user correct the data. The "Sorted JSON" label suggests that the system might have attempted to sort the JSON data before encountering the error.

**4. Technical details (JSON and error):**

*   **JSON:** The JSON data is an array of objects. Each object is intended to represent a person with a "name" (string) and "age" (number).
*   **Error:** The error message "SyntaxError: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 16 (line 1 column 17)" indicates that the JSON parser encountered an unexpected character or token at position 16. Based on the displayed JSON, the error is likely due to an incomplete or malformed object at the end of the array. The last object `{ "r` is incomplete. It's missing a property name and value, and the closing curly brace.

Note: It would be better to check your responses on the TDS portal before finalising the script. You can access the answer box and check button by removing the disable attribute.

@Saransh_Saini

it can‚Äôt be fixed actually, you would need the answer in the json format

`{"answer": "actual_answer"}`

but if the actual_answer needs to be string and if it happens to be of json type, it has to be represented using `\"`

As per the 19th March session, it was mentioned that the files would be the same for everyone, and only the parameters in the questions would vary. However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I‚Äôm attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1‚Äîone is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate.

**Image: mydata**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a table, likely from a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. The table contains data related to transactions, including customer information, product details, sales figures, and costs. The table has a header row and multiple data rows. The background of the table is light green.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The table has the following column headers:

*   **TransactionID:** A unique identifier for each transaction.
*   **Customer Name:** The name of the customer involved in the transaction.
*   **Country:** The country where the customer is located.
*   **Date:** The date of the transaction.
*   **Product/Code:** The product involved in the transaction, along with a code.
*   **Sales:** The sales amount for the transaction.
*   **Cost:** The cost associated with the transaction.

The table contains data for 14 transactions. Here are some examples of the data:

*   TransactionID 0001: John Doe, France, 10-13-2023, Eta/fzflrq, 2021 USD, 1973 USD
*   TransactionID 0002: Frank Thomas, United States, 2022/10/14, Alpha/f2yscp, 6855 USD, 4866 USD
*   TransactionID 0003: Bob Brown, FRA, 09-06-2023, Theta/xvwf8u, 5644 USD, 3504 USD
*   TransactionID 0004: Bob Brown, IND, 01-27-2022, Zeta/4rk2rx, 9273 USD, 1235 USD
*   TransactionID 0005: Charlie Davis, United Arab Emirates, 09-26-2022, Theta/0ylj7e, 5699 USD, 1847 USD
*   TransactionID 0006: Charlie Davis, US, 2022/05/25, Kappa/bquhwf,

**Image: friend data**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a table of data, likely from a spreadsheet or database. The table has several columns: TransactionID, Customer Name, Country, Date, Product/Code, Sales, and Cost. Each row represents a single transaction.

**2. Text Content:**

Here's a breakdown of the text content in each column:

*   **TransactionID:** Numerical IDs, starting from 0001 and going up to 0017.
*   **Customer Name:** A list of names including Frank Thomas, Eve Wilson, Jane Smith, Charlie Davis, John Doe, Alice Johnson, and Bob Brown.
*   **Country:** Country codes or names such as IND (India), US (United States), United Kingdom, Fra (France), AE (United Arab Emirates), U.S.A, U.K, and Bra (Brazil).
*   **Date:** Dates in various formats, such as 12-01-2022, 08-10-2023, and 2022/09/04.
*   **Product/Code:** Product names or codes, often a combination of a product category (e.g., Delta, Alpha, Theta, Eta, Beta, Zeta, Kappa) and a short alphanumeric code (e.g., tbakf3, hknae9, mjrd4g).
*   **Sales:** Numerical values representing sales figures, followed by "USD" (US Dollars).
*   **Cost:** Numerical values representing costs, followed by "USD".

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The table appears to be a record of sales transactions. It includes information about the customer, the product purchased, the date of the transaction, the sales amount, and the cost associated with the product. This type of data is commonly used for sales analysis, inventory management, and financial reporting.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The data is presented in a tabular format, suggesting it could be from a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, or a database management system.
*   The consistent use of "USD" indicates that all sales and cost figures are in US Dollars.
*   The "Product/Code" column suggests a product categorization system is in place.
*

During the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.

The file is just 341kb. it should take less than a second. So you do not have to pre download this file. Only very large ones that are not parameterised you can have a hard copy of.

 lakshaygarg654:

In **GA4 Q2**, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages‚ÄîSpanish, Dutch, I believe.

Questions that require manual intervention will be graded very liberally. In other words those questions will not have as strict a grading criteria as in the GA portal.

 lakshaygarg654:

In **GA4 Q10**, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, @carlton sir had mentioned that the question would be revised.

Here is the [thread link](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/106) for reference.

How should we handle this question now?

Same as above.

Kind regards

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a code snippet, likely from a Google Colab notebook. The code is written in Python and appears to be related to Google Cloud authentication and accessing user information.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Title/Instruction:** "Let's make sure you can access Google Colab. Run this program on Google Colab, allowing all required access to your email ID: 23f1001524@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."
*   **Python Code:**
    *   `import hashlib`
    *   `import requests`
    *   `from google.colab import auth`
    *   `from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials`
    *   `auth.authenticate_user()`
    *   `creds = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()`
    *   `token = creds.get_access_token().access_token`
    *   `response = requests.get("https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo", params={"alt": "json"}, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})`
    *   `email = response.json()["email"]`
    *   `hashlib.sha256(f"{email} {creds.token_expiry.year}".encode()).hexdigest()[-5:]`
*   **Question:** "What is the result? (It should be a 5-character string)"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The code aims to verify access to Google Colab and retrieve user information (specifically the email address) using OAuth 2.0. It then calculates a SHA256 hash of the email address concatenated with the token expiry year and extracts the last 5 characters of the hexadecimal representation of the hash. The purpose is likely to generate a short, unique identifier based on the user's email and token expiry.

**4. Technical Details (Code):**

*   **Imports:** The code imports the `hashlib` library for hashing, the `requests` library for making HTTP requests, `auth` from `google.colab` for authentication within Colab, and `GoogleCredentials` from `oauth2

How to parameterise this function? It is really difficult to do this function with other parameter, please help. what is approach other than hardcoding it?

Did you get a solution for the Markdown question? I have the same issue.

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image appears to be a text-based report or analysis, likely generated from a code environment (like a Jupyter Notebook or similar). It includes:

*   **Textual descriptions:** Explanations, observations, and recommendations.
*   **Code snippet:** A short Python code segment.
*   **Data table:** A small table showing steps walked on specific days.
*   **Headings and subheadings:** To structure the report.
*   **A URL:** A link to a healthline article.

**2. Text Content:**

Here's a breakdown of the text content, organized by section:

*   **Title:** "# Step Analysis Report"
*   **Introduction:**
    *   "Tracking daily steps is an **analysis examines the number of steps walked each day over a week and compares the results over time."
    *   "Data was collected using a fitness tracker and recorded daily. The following steps were taken:"
    *   "Compared daily steps with previous weeks."
    *   "Compared steps with friends to analyze trends."
    *   "Data was logged into a spreadsheet."
    *   "Weekly trends were calculated using a fitness device."
*   **Data Table:**
    *   "| Steps Walked |"
    *   "| Thursday | 10,000 |"
    *   "| Monday | 8,500 |"
    *   "| Friday | 9,600 |"
*   **Code for Step Analysis:**
    *   "To analyze the step data, we used Python:"
    *   `['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']`
    *   `df = pd.DataFrame(data)`
    *   `print(df.describe())`
*   **Observations:**
    *   "The highest step count was recorded on **Sunday**."
    *   "There was a general comparison with Friends"
    *   `> \"Walking together keeps us motivated!\" - A friend from the study group`
    *   "Alice: **10,500** steps/day average"
    *   "Bob: **

Can we rather do PlainTextResponse for the markdown question?

Questions Requiring Clarification/Manual Intervention for Evaluation (As Discussed in Tuesday‚Äôs Session)

Respected TDS Team,

As per the discussion during the Tuesday session, and following @Saransh‚Äôs suggestion, I am creating this post to list the questions that may require manual intervention or are facing issues potentially due to portal-side behavior. Kindly verify these points before evaluation.

 :red_exclamation_mark:  Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue

GA3 Q8

Issue: The question doesn‚Äôt mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.

GA3 Q9

Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN.
Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?

GA4 Q2 & Q10

Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.
Reference: [GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/98)

Output Formatting (Multiple Questions)

Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\n) and backslashes are added.
Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {‚Äúanswer‚Äù: ‚Äúresult‚Äù}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.

Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions

Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.
Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?

Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday‚Äôs Session)

Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:

Platform Capability for GA Tasks

Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?
Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.

File Upload Example via Platform API

Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.
This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.

General Observations on GA1-5

Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.

Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.

@carlton ( @Saransh_Saini ) @Jivraj , is it possible to extend the deadline by 2 days April 1st, since we can use the LLM api a little more and Most people(me atleast) have Their OPPEs and its combined syllabus (and the OPPE 1 did not go well, partly due to my inadequacies) , which has much more to cover, since this project involves more involved coding compared to the last project(ideally project one should have taken not more than a day , still messed it up though xD). Asking for extension for 2 days, if possible. Really need it not even want, like **need**

**Summary: Please extend Project 2 deadline by 2 days(April 1st),**

*(actually 1 day extension is April 1st)*

Hi @23f1002382 ,

Unfortunately it‚Äôs not possible for us to extend the deadline. Project 2 was released almost a month back, and that can be considered ample amount of time to complete the project. I can understand it must be hard to deal with it along with an upcoming OPPE, but this is what it is. Even if you are not able to cover all the 58 questions, try to cover the majority of them, as the evaluation involves sending just 1-3 questions for evals.

All the best for your OPPE and your Project 2  :victory_hand:

Yes you are absolutely right. I confirmed this with Carlton and Anand sir, and yes you have to send the JSON responses as strings, which will automatically add those backslashes(\). I apologies for causing this confusion, and I hope I was able to clarify it.

Hi @21f3001993

You can use the `zipfile` library to extract and access zip files pretty easily. You can even make it so that you don‚Äôt even have to download the sent file either zip/csv/etc, in order to access it. All this will be discussed in Thurday‚Äôs [27-03-2025] Live Session. Kindly attend the session if you want a deeper understanding of it.

It can be 1-5 random questions from all 58 question. Its not like a random question each from each GA. It‚Äôs even possible to get all those 5 questions from one single GA.

just to clarify if the llm is giving the output like this the evaluation script will mark it correct.

{
 "answer": "[{\"name\":\"Charlie\",\"age\":16},{\"name\":\"Liam\",\"age\":23},{\"name\":\"Bob\",\"age\":28},{\"name\":\"Grace\",\"age\":36},{\"name\":\"Ivy\",\"age\":44},{\"name\":\"Jack\",\"age\":53},{\"name\":\"David\",\"age\":56},{\"name\":\"Oscar\",\"age\":57},{\"name\":\"Karen\",\"age\":65},{\"name\":\"Frank\",\"age\":67},{\"name\":\"Nora\",\"age\":68},{\"name\":\"Emma\",\"age\":70},{\"name\":\"Paul\",\"age\":88},{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"age\":92},{\"name\":\"Henry\",\"age\":94},{\"name\":\"Mary\",\"age\":97}]"

Yes, it will. Just make sure that doing a json.loads() on this string should give you the desired output.

The GA portal marks it as wrong unless I manually insert new lines. I hope that won‚Äôt be an issue, will it?

Your markdown must have newline characters or spaces wherever necessary. Otherwise we will not be able to check if your answer is correct. Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file.

Please review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters.

The browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists.

The programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters. (Usually)

To check if a string has invisible characters,

# Multi-line string
my_string = """Hello
World    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	"""

# Print ASCII values of each character
print([ord(c) for c in my_string])

e.g., newline = 10, tab = 9

This is a great way to check what we are receiving when you send us some response,

import requests
import json

# This is just an example server to see what we see.

url = "https://httpbin.org/post"

my_multiline_string_answer = """This is a multiline
string that spans
multiple lines    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	as well."""

response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": my_multiline_string_answer
}

# Send the JSON data
response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

# Check the response
print (response.status_code)
print (response.json ())
print (response.text)

# Do other checks as necessary... 

See what happens when I print the result

print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])

**Image: Screenshot 2025-03-27 at 1.09.56 pm**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal window, likely on a macOS system, displaying the output of a Python script. The terminal prompt is visible before and after the script's output.

**2. Text Content:**

The terminal displays the following text:

*   `.venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro tds % /User`
*   `tds/test.py`
*   `This is a multiline`
*   `string that spans`
*   `multiple lines with spaces`
*   `and some newlines`
*   `and a tab as well.`
*   `.venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro tds %`

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows the execution of a Python script named `test.py` located in the `tds` directory within the `/User` directory. The script appears to print a multiline string to the console. The string is designed to demonstrate how strings can span multiple lines and include spaces, newlines, and tabs.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The terminal prompt indicates the user is `venvcarland` on a machine named `Carlton-MacBook-Pro`.
*   The current working directory is `tds`.
*   The script `test.py` is executed, and its output is displayed.
*   The output is a string that spans multiple lines and includes spaces, newlines, and a tab character. This suggests the script likely contains a multiline string literal or uses string formatting to create the output.

Its a proper multiline correctly formatted text! The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA.

Here is a json example:

json_answer = {
    "mary": "poppins",
    "age": 42
}

stringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer)
response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": stringed_json
}

response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])

Look at the response. A perfect json.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-03-27 at 3.30.17 pm**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal or command-line interface (CLI). It displays text-based output, likely from running a Python script.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   `.venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro tds %` (appears twice)
*   `tds/test.py`
*   `{"mary": "poppins", "age": 42}`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The terminal output suggests the following:

*   `.venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro` is likely the username and hostname of the machine. `Carlton-MacBook-Pro` is the hostname, and `carland` is the username. The `.venv` part indicates that a virtual environment is activated.
*   `tds` is likely the current working directory.
*   `%` is the terminal prompt.
*   `tds/test.py` indicates that a Python script named `test.py` located in the `tds` directory was executed.
*   `{"mary": "poppins", "age": 42}` is a JSON-formatted string, likely the output of the `test.py` script. It represents a dictionary with two key-value pairs: "mary" with the value "poppins", and "age" with the value 42.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The image shows a typical terminal interaction. The user is in a virtual environment (`.venv`), navigates to a directory (`tds`), and executes a Python script (`test.py`).
*   The Python script likely prints a dictionary to standard output, which is then displayed in the terminal as a JSON string.
*   The presence of the terminal prompt (`%`) at the beginning and end indicates the start and end of the interaction. The prompt at the end suggests the user can enter another command.

If you do not want spaces in the response then strip the spaces before you send the stringified response.

Kind regards

I would request the TDS team to please consider making the evaluation criteria for project 2 a bit more liberal.

5 random Questions with 4 marks each is quite harsh. I request you to make it more balanced like 2 Qs from each GA with 2 marks each or so. So that even if we can‚Äôt exhaustively cover the whole number of questions, it gives mercy for the partial completion.

5 random question is a kind of lottery or luck based unless our app is perfect. Thanks

Hey guys, I have designed the code, and it currently works for the first 11 GA1 questions and the sixth and third questions of GA2. I have accounted for all edge cases. Please check the code at this link:

[https://4e52-43-230-106-58.ngrok-free.app/](https://4e52-43-230-106-58.ngrok-free.app/).

**GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages**

As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address `21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.

To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page‚Äôs availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10‚Äì20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process‚Äîfrom initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live‚Äîtakes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.

However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly‚Äîbefore the GitHub Pages site is actually live‚Äîresulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a **502 Bad Gateway** error, likely due to Azure‚Äôs request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform‚Äôs allowed response duration.

**GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files**

A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a **502 Bad Gateway** error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure‚Äôs execution time limit.

Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.

Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.

Below Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Left Side: API Response**

1.  **UI Elements:**
    *   The left side of the image displays what appears to be an API response viewer. It has sections for the request URL, server response code, response body, and response headers.
    *   There are buttons for "Copy" (represented by a clipboard icon) and "Download".

2.  **Text Content:**
    *   **Request URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`
    *   **Server Response:**
        *   **Code:** `200`
        *   **Response Body:**
            ```json
            {
                "answer": "https://21f3001076.github.io/github-pages-20250327144836/"
            }
            ```
        *   **Response Headers:**
            ```
            access-control-allow-credentials: true
            access-control-allow-origin: *
            content-length: 70
            content-type: application/json
            date: Thu, 27 Mar 2025 09:18:35 GMT
            server: uvicorn
            ```

3.  **Context/Purpose:**
    *   This section shows the response from an API endpoint. The API is running locally (127.0.0.1:8000). The response indicates a successful request (HTTP 200). The response body contains a JSON object with a key "answer" whose value is a URL. The response headers provide information about the response, such as content type, length, and server.

4.  **Technical Details:**
    *   The API is likely a REST API.
    *   The server is identified as "uvicorn," which is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server implementation, often used with Python web frameworks like FastAPI.
    *   The `access-control-allow-origin: *` header indicates that Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled, allowing requests from any origin.

**Final Thoughts on Project 2**

Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I‚Äôd like to share a few reflections‚Äînot as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.

**Organization & Structure:**

The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I‚Äôm not blaming anyone‚Äîjust sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.
**Deployment & Portal Limitations:**

There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.
**Time Constraints:**

Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.
**Sessions & Support:**

The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.
**Deployment Variability:**

Each GA‚Äôs questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.
**Effort Acknowledgment:**

I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors‚Äîit‚Äôs clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it‚Äôs also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail‚Äîeven the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.
**Feasibility in the Given Timeline:**

Even for someone with a technical background, it‚Äôs difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn‚Äôt always feasible before the deadline.

I genuinely hope someone is able to complete **all 57 questions** successfully‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to learn from their experience and solutions.

Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know‚ÄîI‚Äôm happy to edit or delete the post if needed.

**Thank you for the learning opportunity**

If there is any plan for extension, I request the TDS team to announce it in advance as people would rush and submit, then, they come hear about the extension when they had submitted it already.

Happened to me like almost every time. We have OPPE this weekend, so if there is slightest possibility, I request to announce it in advance.

Thanks

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays text content, specifically instructions or a task description related to analyzing Apache web log data. It outlines the format of the log entries and provides specific tasks to perform on the data.

**2. Text Content:**

The text includes:

*   **Title:** "Your Task"
*   **Description of the log file:**  A GZipped Apache log file (61MB) with 258,074 rows. Each row represents an Apache web log entry for the site s-anand.net in May 2024.
*   **Field descriptions:** A bulleted list describing the fields in each log entry:
    *   IP: The IP address of the visitor
    *   Remote logname: The remote logname of the visitor. Typically "-"
    *   Remote user: The remote user of the visitor. Typically "-"
    *   Time: The time of the visit. E.g. \[01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]. Note that this is not quoted and you need to handle this.
    *   Request: The request made by the visitor. E.g. GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1. It has 3 space-separated parts, namely (a) Method: The HTTP method. E.g. GET (b) URL: The URL visited. E.g. /blog/ (c) Protocol: The HTTP protocol. E.g. HTTP/1.1
    *   Status: The HTTP status code. If 200 

Dear Sirs,

I have a question regarding Q3 and Q4 of GA5. When calling the API, should we pass the `.gz` file directly, or will the API accept a Google Drive link from which it can download the `.gz` file?

Specifically, will the API call be structured as follows?

Essentialy, will the API call look like so?

curl -X POST ‚Äú[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)‚Äù 

-H ‚ÄúContent-Type: multipart/form-data‚Äù 

-F "question=Bandwidth Analysis for Regional Contents - [anand.net](http://anand.net) is a personal website that had region-specific music content. One of the site‚Äôs key sections is tamilmp3, which hosts music files and is especially popular among the local audience. The website is powered by robust Apache web servers that record detailed access logs. These logs are essential for understanding user behavior, server load, and content engagement. By analyzing the server‚Äôs Apache log file, the author can identify heavy users and take measures to manage bandwidth, improve site performance, or even investigate potential abuse. Your Task: This GZipped Apache log file has 258,074 rows. Each row is an Apache web log entry for the site [s-anand.net](http://s-anand.net) in May 2024. Each row has these fields:

IP: The IP address of the visitor.

Remote logname: The remote logname of the visitor. Typically ‚Äò-‚Äô.

Remote user: The remote user of the visitor. Typically ‚Äò-‚Äô.

Time: The time of the visit. E.g. [01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]. Note that this is not quoted, and you need to handle this.

Request: The request made by the visitor. E.g. GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1. It has three space-separated parts:

(a) Method: The HTTP method. E.g. GET.

(b) URL: The URL visited. E.g. /blog/.

(c) Protocol: The HTTP protocol. E.g. HTTP/1.1.

Status: The HTTP status code. If 200 <= Status < 300, it is a successful request.

Size: The size of the response in bytes. E.g. 1234.

Referer: The referer URL. E.g. [https://s-anand.net/](https://s-anand.net/).

User agent: The browser used. This will contain spaces and might have escaped quotes.

Vhost: The virtual host. E.g. [s-anand.net](http://s-anand.net).

Server: The IP address of the server.

The fields are separated by spaces and quoted by double quotes (‚Äò-‚Äô). Unlike CSV files, quoted fields are escaped via \" and not ‚Äò-‚Äô. (This impacts 41 rows.)

All data is in the GMT-0500 timezone, and the questions are based on this same timezone.

Filter the Log Entries: Extract only the requests where the URL starts with /tamilmp3/. Include only those requests made on the specified 2024-05-23.

Aggregate Data by IP: Sum the ‚ÄòSize‚Äô field for each unique IP address from the filtered entries.

Identify the Top Data Consumer: Determine the IP address that has the highest total downloaded bytes. Report the total number of bytes that this IP address downloaded.

Across all requests under tamilmp3/ on 2024-05-23, how many bytes did the top IP address (by volume of downloads) download?" 

-F ‚Äúfile=@s-anand.net-May-2024.gz‚Äù

I would appreciate your clarification on whether the `.gz` file should be directly included in the API request or if a Google Drive link should be provided instead.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

**GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files**

A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a **502 Bad Gateway** error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure‚Äôs execution time limit.
Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.

@carlton

I watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.

How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn‚Äôt help.

@s.anand

@carlton @Jivraj

Also, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE.

It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.

I believe it would strike a good balance‚Äîteam made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else.

Hello sir,

My question is, the questions my endpoint will be evaluated are they the exact same ones with same parameters for my respective email as on the assignment portal ?

Essentially I am trying to understand there are certain questions where I don‚Äôt have to solve the question again and just return the hardcoded answers, would that be correct ?

Anyone please respond and also for ga 1 q 8 for instance where we have:

Let‚Äôs make sure you know how to use JSON. Sort this JSON array of objects by the value of the `age` field. In case of a tie, sort by the `name` field. Paste the resulting JSON below without any spaces or newlines.

[{"name":"Alice","age":67},{"name":"Bob","age":53},{"name":"Charlie","age":34},{"name":"David","age":89},{"name":"Emma","age":92},{"name":"Frank","age":37},{"name":"Grace","age":4},{"name":"Henry","age":49},{"name":"Ivy","age":30},{"name":"Jack","age":2},{"name":"Karen","age":2},{"name":"Liam","age":5},{"name":"Mary","age":32},{"name":"Nora","age":56},{"name":"Oscar","age":19},{"name":"Paul","age":22}]

Sorted JSON:

here would question be sent as text only or text + json file seperately?

Hi @22f3002933

Files are less likely to change, but parameters are. For instance, GA1_Q12, the zip file is less likely to change but the symbols to perform the aggregate on would be changed.

Hi @lakshaygarg654,

Yes for GA4_Q9 the PDF files are different for everyone, but the workflow is exactly the same. Its a basic tabula read, with no particular need of any preprocessing. So, yeah you have to fetch it from the API request.

Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt extend Project 2 deadline, it was released on 3rd of March, and we believe ample amount of time was given for it. If you are lagging far behind in the race, we would encourage you to collaborate with other and get the project done.

Thanks for the answer sir.

I remember being told on the last session, that the question will be exactly the same we have on the assignment portal for my respective case, and the answer on the portal can be the same here as well.

Actually I am exploring a hardcoded answer route where if i return the answer which I already got after solving the questions on the portal (in certain qns with dynamic functions) , so thought of asking if method is alright.

Yes sending your GA answer as text as the JSON response can work if the question was not parameterized. I hope you are aware that parameters for some questions will be changed, resulting in different answers.

Thanks for your reply @Saransh_Saini

I‚Äôve figured out the solution to that particular question.

The deadline is still a concern, as many issues were only resolved during recent sessions‚Äîsimilar to the project 1 workflow‚Äîand This time there are many other things in the pipeline ( viva‚Äôs and oppe‚Äôs )

Anyway, I will complete this course with valuable learnings, but many others have been seriously affected by it.

Hi @Saransh_Saini @carlton ,

In the sample curl command

i.e.

curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the "answer" column of the CSV file?" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip"

It is given that only one file arguement is passed , can there be a usecase where multiple files are sent , for example GA-5 10th question Image reconstruction where there could be one file be the image another could be separate file with mapping, Although mapping can be given with question as well,

But still can you please confirm if there will be only one file or there can be multiple files send to API?

Query about Week2 Q3 and  Q7 Publishing a page or action takes time to reflect the site or action performed in github. how to solve this timing issue ? Github repo creation and file /action addition completes immediately but publishing of file /action takes time causing the resulting URL to return 404 for a long time before it returns the correct 200 status and content in response.

Hello Sir,

I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using `vicky_server.py`, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. `My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.`

However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as ‚Äúquestion.pdf.‚Äù How can I effectively manage this problem?

Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word ‚Äúcode‚Äù and executes `first.py` for GA1.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project!

Best regards,

vicky kumar

In GA5_Q10 the mappings would be sent as either a HTML or Markdown file along with the image. Both files would be send as a List.

@carlton

I am bit confused about  answer evaluation process. Can you tell which one  is correct process.

1st process ( I used json.dumps() to get my_response as json formatted string)

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a code snippet, likely from a Python environment, along with its output. The code is displayed in a light-colored text editor or IDE. Below the code, there's an output area showing the result of the code execution. There is a play button to the left of the code.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Code:**
    *   `import json`
    *   `my_response = "{\"answer\": \"26272\"}"`
    *   `print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])`
*   **Output:**
    *   `26272`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The code demonstrates how to parse a JSON string in Python and extract a specific value. The `json` library is imported, a JSON string is assigned to the `my_response` variable, and then the `json.loads()` function is used to convert the string into a Python dictionary. Finally, the code accesses the value associated with the key "answer" in the dictionary and prints it to the console. The output shows that the value "26272" was successfully extracted and printed.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The code uses the `json.loads()` function, which is part of Python's built-in `json` library. This function parses a JSON string and returns a Python dictionary or list.
*   The `my_response` variable contains a JSON string representing a dictionary with a single key-value pair. The key is "answer", and the value is "26272".
*   The code accesses the value associated with the key "answer" using dictionary indexing: `my_response["answer"]`.
*   The `print()` function displays the extracted value to the console.

2nd process ( This one is Json object)

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a snippet of Python code and its output. It appears to be from an interactive Python environment like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, as indicated by the "[14]" notation.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Code:**
    *   `import json`
    *   `my_response = {"answer": "26272"}`
    *   `print(my_response["answer"])`
*   **Output:**
    *   `26272`
*   **Other:**
    *   `[14]` (likely an execution counter in a notebook environment)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The code demonstrates how to access a value from a Python dictionary. The dictionary `my_response` is created with a single key-value pair: the key is "answer" and the value is the string "26272". The `print()` statement then accesses the value associated with the "answer" key and prints it to the console. The output shows that the value "26272" was successfully retrieved and printed. The `import json` statement is present, but not used in the code.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The code is written in Python.
*   It uses a dictionary data structure.
*   It demonstrates string indexing to access dictionary values.
*   The `json` library is imported, but not used in the code.

or both are incorrect?

This is one more example of 1st process after json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer:

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a code snippet, likely written in Python. It appears to be a script designed to interact with the OpenAI API to perform sentiment analysis. The code is presented in a text editor or IDE with syntax highlighting.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The code contains the following key elements:

*   **Imports:** `import json`
*   **Variable `my_response`:** This variable holds a string that represents a JSON object. The JSON object contains a key "answer" whose value is a string containing Python code.
*   **String containing Python code:**
    *   `import httpx`
    *   `def analyze_sentiment():`
    *   `url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"`
    *   `headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer dummy_api_key", "Content-Type": "application/json"}`
    *   `data = {"model": "gpt-40-mini", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Analyze the sentiment of the given text and classify it as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL."},{"role": "user", "content": "\"\"\"P5I 3P1xw aE WvYHB6zc5xB SY4QzV 0bM8tDP7e o MOG4R9\"\"\""}]}`
    *   `response = httpx.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)`
    *   `response.raise_for_status()`
    *   `result = response.json()`
    *   `return result`
    *   `if __name__ == "__main__":`
    *   `try:`
    *   `sentiment_result = analyze_sentiment()`
    *   `print(sentiment_result)`
    *   `except Exception as e:`
    *   `print(f"Error: {e}")`
*   **Final line:** `print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The code aims to:

1.  **Define a function `analyze_sentiment

This is one more example of 2nd process without use of json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer:

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a code snippet, likely written in Python. It appears to be a program designed to analyze the sentiment of a given text using the OpenAI API. The code is presented in a text editor or IDE with syntax highlighting.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The code contains the following key text elements:

*   `import json`
*   `my_response = { ... }`
*   `"answer": "..."` (This contains a large string with embedded newlines and escaped characters)
*   `import httpx`
*   `def analyze_sentiment():`
*   `url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"`
*   `headers = { ... }`
*   `"Authorization": "Bearer dummy_api_key"`
*   `"Content-Type": "application/json"`
*   `data = { ... }`
*   `"model": "gpt-40-mini"`
*   `"messages": [ ... ]`
*   `{"role": "system", "content": "Analyze the sentiment of the given text and classify it as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL."}`
*   `{"role": "user", "content": "\"\"\"P513P1xw aE WvYHB6zc5xBSY4QzV 0bM8tDP7e o MOG4R9\"\"\"}`
*   `response = httpx.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)`
*   `response.raise_for_status()`
*   `result = response.json()`
*   `return result`
*   `if __name__ == "__main__":`
*   `try:`
*   `sentiment_result = analyze_sentiment()`
*   `print(sentiment_result)`
*   `except Exception as e:`
*   `print(f"Error: {e}")`
*   `print(my_response["answer"])`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The code aims to:

*   Define a function `analyze_sentiment()` that interacts with

I am trying to create a student account on Microsoft Azure using my IIT Madras email ID (**23f2004705@ds.study.iitm.ac.in**), but I am encountering an issue. The system is showing a message that my email domain is not currently registered with them, and it is asking me to use another verification method.

@carlton @Jivraj Could you please guide me on how to proceed with the verification or if there is an alternative method to access Azure‚Äôs student benefits?

**Image: Screenshot 2025-03-29 145801**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) element from Microsoft Azure, specifically a section related to academic verification. It appears to be a web page or a part of a web application.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Header:** "Microsoft Azure" (with the Microsoft logo)
*   **User Information:** "23f2004705@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" and "Sign out"
*   **Error Message:** "Your email domain is not currently registered with us. You can choose another verification method."
*   **Section Title:** "Academic Verification"
*   **Instructions:** "Start by entering your name as per the school records. Select your school's country and enter your school's name. Enter your date of birth as per the school records. The email address may be used to reach you if we have trouble verifying your application, so please enter your school provided email address."

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The purpose of the displayed UI is to verify a user's academic affiliation. The user's email domain is not recognized, so the system is prompting them to provide additional information to prove their student status. The instructions guide the user to enter their name, school country, school name, and date of birth as they appear in the school's records. The system also emphasizes the importance of providing the school-provided email address for verification purposes.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The UI is likely part of a larger web application built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
*   The "Academic Verification" section is likely a collapsible/expandable element, as indicated by the upward-pointing arrow.
*   The system is performing some form of email domain validation to determine if a user's email address is associated with a recognized academic institution.
*   The system likely uses a database to store and verify the entered information against school records.

**Image: tds**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web form for "Academic Verification." It appears to be part of a larger application or registration process. The form includes fields for:

*   First name
*   Last name
*   Country (dropdown)
*   School name
*   Date of birth (partially visible)

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   "Your email domain is not currently registered with us. You can choose another verification method." (at the top)
*   "Academic Verification" (title)
*   "Start by entering your name as per the school records. Select your school's country and enter your school's name. Enter your date of birth as per the school records. The email address may be used to reach you if we have trouble verifying your application, so please enter your school provided email address." (instructional text)
*   "First name" (label for the first name field)
*   "shashikumar" (value entered in the first name field)
*   "Last name" (label for the last name field)
*   "This field is required" (error message in red, below the last name field)
*   "Country" (label for the country dropdown)
*   "India" (selected value in the country dropdown)
*   "If your country is not listed, the offer is not available in your region. Learn More"
*   "School name" (label for the school name field)
*   "Indian Institute Of Technology Madras (Chennai, Tamil Nadu)" (value entered in the school name field)
*   "School name will help provide Microsoft with additional information for verification. If available, please enter it here."
*   "Date of birth" (label for the date of birth field)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The purpose of the form is to verify the user's academic affiliation. The user is required to provide their name, country, school name, and date of birth, presumably to match records held by the school or a central academic database. The initial message indicates that the user's email domain is not recognized, suggesting that the form is an alternative verification method.

**4. Technical details:**

Hi @lakshaygarg654

In both the scenarios you laid out, the second implementation is correct. Your response to our API request should be a JSON object `{"answer" : "YOUR RESPONSE AS STRING"}`. In any case the value of the `"answer"` key should be a string.

Hosting it anywhere is fine. Try to deploy on vercel first, if that doesn‚Äôt succeed you can use any other hosting technique.

This is a basic prototype function we would be using to send requests to your URL.

def run(question, file_path):
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api"
    questions = {'question': question}
    files = [
        ('file', open("abcd.zip", 'rb')),
        ('file', open("dcba.img", 'rb'))
    ]
    response = requests.post(url, data=questions, files=files)
    return response

or

curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip" \
  -F "file=@dcba.img"

***NOTE**: This is not the evaluation script.*

HI @ripusudan

This has been a problem with all direct entry students. Unfortunately, there is no way we can help you with this problem. The best way out is asking a friend who is not a TDS student for this term to create a Azure VM for you.

I couldn‚Äôt find this function on the Project Doc and I made the project based on the curl function calling.

 Saransh_Saini:

curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip" \
  -F "file=@dcba.img"

At this moment it can‚Äôt be changed as I am occupied with other things. Please keep the question parameter as ‚Äúquestion‚Äù and file parameter as ‚Äúfile‚Äù in the evaluation which is on the Project 2 page and the content type as multipart/form-data.

To clarify if I can handle any one of these 2 methods, I will be fine?

Edit:

Just now discovered that the field names are indeed ‚Äúquestion‚Äù and ‚Äúfile‚Äù only in both the cases. Sorry for the oversight.

@carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj

I have a few queries. Even a yes/no response for each would suffice.

GA1:

Q13 - Use GitHub: Since the parameter is just my email, this question *WILL NOT* be tested against any other email, right? So I can just have a repo with my email in it, right?

GA2:

Q2 - Compress an image: Should my app‚Äôs response be like this

{
     "answer": "base64_encoding_of_compressed_image"
}

Q3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too **WILL NOT** be checked against any other email, right?

GA3:

Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate here.

GA4:

The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions. When the question will be sent to my app, will the link of the website to be scraped be written as a full link in the question itself or will it be sent in some other way?

GA5:

No particular questions at the moment.

Please help me out by answering these asap

Hello @22f3001307, there is an error in the code that needs to be fixed as part of the question:

image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys)[0]

with

What Jivraj agreed was stringifying the answer and putting it in as the value of the `"answer"` key in the JSON object.

`{ "answer" : "YOUR_STRINGIFIED_ANSWER" }`

Just check the Project 2 page on the portal. It‚Äôs clearly mentioned a JSON object has to sent not a strigified version of the entire JSON object.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **What is shown in the image:** The image shows text instructions and a code snippet. The code snippet is a JSON object.

2.  **Text content visible:**
    *   "The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:"
    *   `{`
    *   `"answer": "1234567890"`
    *   `}`
    *   `json`

3.  **Context or purpose:** The image provides instructions on how to format a response to an assignment. The response should be a JSON object containing a single field named "answer", which should hold a text string. The JSON code snippet serves as an example of the expected format.

4.  **Technical details:** The code snippet is a valid JSON object. It consists of curly braces `{}` enclosing a key-value pair. The key is `"answer"` (a string), and the value is `"1234567890"` (another string). The "json" text in the upper right corner indicates the format of the code.

Response from api should be a string, which if we load using json.loads it should load json object with answer key.

22f3000819:

Q13 - Use GitHub: Since the parameter is just my email, this question *WILL NOT* be tested against any other email, right? So I can just have a repo with my email in it, right?

Check with other student if they have a different email then it is a parameter and can change.

 22f3000819:

Q2 - Compress an image: Should my app‚Äôs response be like this

{
     "answer": "base64_encoding_of_compressed_image"

This is correct, make sure you test decoding base64 string before deadline.

 22f3000819:

Q3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too **WILL NOT** be checked against any other email, right?

Same answer as Q13 GA1

 22f3000819:

Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate her

We will take Q1 in this format, which is just copy pasting from portal```

One of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text:

au7BK3 33 H 5   lKz6y4n  oQmbgoX 0  hNW3JH  68Q1u

Write a Python program that uses `httpx` to send a POST request to OpenAI‚Äôs API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL. Specifically:

Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key.
Use `gpt-4o-mini` as the model.
The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories.
The second message must be **exactly** the text contained above.

This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications.

**Note**: This uses a dummy `httpx` library, not the real one. You can only use:

`response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs)`
`response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs)`
`response.raise_for_status()`
`response.json()`

-F "question=Let‚Äôs make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won‚Äôt work in Excel)

=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 1, 9), 1, 10))

As per the portal, we have to return a JSON object as a response from the API. However, if we load a JSON object directly using `json.load()`, it will throw an error. We need to first convert it into a JSON string and then load it using `json.loads( )`. For clarity I add image below.

This question has been stretched for too long‚Äîit‚Äôs not that big.

I guess @Jivraj is right.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows Python code snippets and a traceback, likely from an interactive Python environment like Jupyter Notebook or IPython.  It demonstrates an attempt to parse a JSON-like dictionary and access a specific key.  There are two separate code blocks. The first one results in a `TypeError`, while the second one executes successfully.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Code Block 1:**
    *   `import json`
    *   `my_response = { "answer": "26272" }`
    *   `print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])`
*   **Traceback:**
    *   `TypeError`
    *   ` in ()`
    *   `6 print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])`
    *   `/usr/lib/python3.11/json/__init__.py in loads(s, cls, object_hook=None, parse_float=None, parse_int=None, parse_constant=None, object_pairs_hook=None, **kw)`
    *   `338 if not isinstance(s, (bytes, bytearray)):`
    *   `339 raise TypeError(f'the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not {s.__class__.__name__}')`
    *   `TypeError: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not `
*   **Code Block 2:**
    *   `import json`
    *   `my_response = { "answer": "26272" }`
    *   `#converting json object to string as "{\"answer\": \"26272\"}"`
    *   `my_response = json.dumps(my_response)`
    *   `print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])`
*   **Output:**
    *   `26272`

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The code aims to parse a JSON-like structure and extract the value associated with

Subject: Request for Uniform Evaluation Process in Project 2 - TDS Solver.

Hello @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini sir.

We truly appreciate the effort you put into designing and evaluating our graded assignments and projects. We understand that any five random questions will be selected for evaluation, and we fully respect this approach.

However, we kindly request that the same set of five questions be used for all students to ensure a uniform and unbiased evaluation process. This way, the difficulty level remains consistent across all evaluations, providing a fair assessment of our understanding.

Thank you for considering our request. We appreciate your guidance and support.

Best regards,

Digvijaysinh Chudasama.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays instructions for a task, likely related to web scraping or data extraction. It outlines the steps to retrieve movie data from IMDb, filter it based on rating, format it into a JSON structure, and submit the data. The instructions are presented in a numbered list format. There's also an example of the expected JSON output.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The image contains the following text:

*   **"Your Task"** (Title)
*   **"1. Source:"** Utilize IMDb's advanced web search at [https://www.imdb.com/search/title/](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/) to access movie data.
*   **"2. Filter:"** Filter all titles with a rating between 2 and 8.
*   **"3. Format:"** For up to the first 25 titles, extract the necessary details: ID, title, year, and rating. The ID of the movie is the part of the URL after `tt` in the `href` attribute. For example, `tt10078772`. Organize the data into a JSON structure as follows:
*   JSON example:
    *   `[`
    *   `{ "id": "tt1234567", "title": "Movie 1", "year": "2021", "rating": "5.8" },`
    *   `{ "id": "tt7654321", "title": "Movie 2", "year": "2019", "rating": "6.2" },`
    *   `// ... more titles`
    *   `]`
*   **"4. Submit:"** Submit the JSON data in the text box below.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image provides instructions for a data extraction task. The goal is to retrieve movie data from IMDb, filter it based on rating, and format it into a JSON structure. This is a common task in data science, web scraping, or software development where data needs to be extracted from a website and organized for further processing or analysis.

**4. Technical details if it

For this question, The answer which we get is not same as the expected answer which the portal fetch through proxy fetch

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a code snippet, likely JavaScript, within a code editor. The code appears to be related to fetching and parsing data from IMDb (Internet Movie Database).

**2. Any text content visible:**

The code contains the following key text elements:

*   `r > n && ([n, r] = [r, n]);`
*   `let s, d = async g => { ... }`
*   `g = "[\n {\n \"id\": \"tt13406094\",\n \"title\": \"1. The White Lotus\",\n \"year\": \"2021-\",\n \"rating\": \"8.0\"\n },\n {\n`
*   `if (!s) { ... }`
*   `let h = await fetch('/proxy/https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?user_rating=${r},${n}');`
*   `if (h.ok) s = await h.text(); else throw new Error('I wasn't able to get the IMDb data to verify. Please try again. Response: ${h.status} ${h.statusText}')`
*   `let l = [...new DOMParser().parseFromString(s, "text/html").querySelectorAll(".ipc-metadata-list-summary-item")].map(h => { l = Array(25)`
*   `let m = h.querySelector(".ipc-title-link-wrapper").getAttribute("href").match(/(tt\d+)/)[1]`
*   `b = h.querySelector(".ipc-title__text").textContent`
*   `S = h.querySelector(".dli-title-metadata-item").textContent`
*   `w = h.querySelector(".ipc-rating-star--rating").textContent;`
*   `return { id: m, title: b, year: S, rating: w }`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The code's purpose is to:

*   Potentially reorder two variables `r` and `n` if `r` is greater than `n`.
*   Define an asynchronous function `g` that fetches data

let h = await fetch('/proxy/‚Ä¶) ------------> here

@Jivraj @carlton sir because of this mismatch we have to edit manually after clicking check button again and again

please guide me how to solve this

@carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj I just wanted to bring to your attention that in GA4 question 2, the answer evaluation script expects the movie title as ‚Äú17. Kraven: The Hunter‚Äù but it is actually listed on the IMDb page as ‚Äú17. Kraven the Hunter‚Äù, resulting in the correct one being marked wrong.

No questions here just wanted to bring it to attention so that it does not affect the project evaluation script.

Its unusual to have a docker container worth 7 GBs of space. Here is what you can do

Remove unused libraries from your `requirements.txt`. Sometimes having resource demanding libraries like `SentenceTransformers` can install large sub-dependency packages.
Exclude your virtual environment folder from the container creation
Create a `.containerignore` file to have an exception for those folders you want to skip.
Clear your package cache and any vscode cache you might have.

In the previous replies, you‚Äôve mentioned that for Github questions ‚Üí actions, pages (GA2) that if the email changes for everyone it means that its parameterised. However, in one of the live sessions this week, Carlton had mentioned that for these questions, it wont be parameterised as this is very individual specific. The same goes for the docker hub question of GA2 as well. KIndly clarify on the same.

For GA2 Q9 ‚Üí I have given an input file via post request and my fastapi server can handle get requests and its as follows. Kindly confirm if my url is good to go for this specific question.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a UI for interacting with a REST API endpoint. It includes sections for:

*   **API Endpoint Details:**  The HTTP method (POST) and endpoint path (/api) are displayed, along with a brief description of the API's purpose (uploading a CSV file and returning student data).

@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

Sir, in GA4 Question 7, the portal gives the boundary of ultra-new user as the exact time when it was opened, right?

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a snippet of a user interface, likely from a web application or tool related to data analysis and recruitment. It includes:

*   **Text descriptions:** Bullet points outlining benefits.
*   **Input field:** A greyed-out input field for entering a date.
*   **Instructions:** Text providing instructions on how to use the tool.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   "Competitive Intelligence: Stay updated on emerging trends within local developer communities and adjust talent acquisition strategies accordingly."
    *   "Efficiency: Automating repetitive data collection tasks frees up time for recruiters to focus on engagement and relationship-building."
    *   "Data-Driven Decisions: Leverage standardized and reliable data to support strategic business decisions in recruitment and market research."
*   **Input Field Prompt:** "Enter the date (ISO 8601, e.g. "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z") when the newest user joined GitHub."
*   **Search Instructions:** "Search using `location:` and `followers`: filters, sort by `joined` descending, fetch the first `url`, and enter the `created_at` field. Ignore ultra-new users who JUST joined, i.e. after"
*   **Date:** "3/30/2025, 7:21:18 PM."

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image describes a tool or feature designed to help recruiters and talent acquisition specialists. The tool seems to focus on:

*   **Gathering competitive intelligence:** By monitoring developer communities.
*   **Improving efficiency:** By automating data collection.
*   **Making data-driven decisions:** By leveraging standardized data.

The tool allows users to search for GitHub users based on location and follower count, sorting by join date. It appears to be designed to identify and filter out very recent users.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **ISO 8601 Date Format:** The tool expects a date in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z

So, will this boundary for ultra-new user be sent as parameter in the question or can my app use datetime.now() to set the ultra-new user boundary?

**Image: reconstructed_jigsaw**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image depicts a futuristic cityscape, likely at night. It features towering skyscrapers with unique architectural designs, illuminated with bright neon lights, primarily in shades of blue and pink. There are elevated highways crisscrossing the city, with streaks of light indicating fast-moving vehicles. In the sky, there are several flying vehicles resembling futuristic cars or spaceships.

**2. Any text content visible:**

There is no clearly legible text in the image. Some buildings have what appear to be neon signs, but the text is too small and blurry to read.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image is a visual representation of a futuristic urban environment. It evokes a sense of technological advancement, vibrant city life, and perhaps a touch of cyberpunk aesthetic. It could be used for various purposes, such as:

*   Science fiction or fantasy book covers
*   Video game concept art
*   Background for a futuristic website or presentation
*   Illustrative material for articles about future cities or technology

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

This is not a code screenshot or technical diagram. It appears to be a digitally created image, possibly using 3D rendering software or AI image generation tools. The image has a high level of detail and a painterly quality, suggesting it may have been enhanced or stylized. The use of light and color creates a dynamic and visually appealing scene.

through this i got this image in my file output directly

and is your internal server capable of extracted from given location or we have to handle this internally

I am going to clarify this once and for all

The response should be a **JSON Object** with the value of the `"answer"` key as a string.

{ "answer" : "YOUR_ANSWER_AS_STRING" }

This is the way we are expecting your responses.

However, due to the heavy confusion among students and will be considering responses with entire JSON objects stringified. We don‚Äôt want anyone to loose their marks for such a miniscule error.

So,

"{\"answer\": \"YOUR_ANSWER\"}"

is also valid.

@Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @carlton

Sir, I have an issue in GA5 Q3

What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under **/telugu/** from **11:00** until before **20:00** on Mondays?

For this, I have used two python scripts to get the answer, one written completely by me and another from someone else‚Äôs solution; both give the same answer - **2698**

However, the portal says it‚Äôs incorrect. No modifications resulting in different answer are being accepted either and the modifications themselves seem to break the bounds of the question.

Please check the scripts and tell me where I am going wrong.

My script:

import subprocess
from datetime import datetime

def isDay(dtobj, day):
  return dtobj.weekday() == day

def isTime(dtobj, l, u):
  return l <= dtobj.hour < u

step1 = subprocess.run("cat data | grep -i 'GET /telugu/'", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
subprocess.run("rm -f forstep2.txt", shell=True)
with open('forstep2.txt', 'a') as f:
  for line in step1.stdout.splitlines():
    try:
      status = int(line.split()[8])
    except Exception as e:
      status = 400
    if 200 <= status < 300:
      f.write(line + '\n')
step2 = subprocess.run("cat forstep2.txt | cut -d ' ' -f4", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
count = 0
for line in step2.stdout.splitlines():
  log_datetime = datetime.strptime(line.strip('['), "%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S")
  if(isDay(log_datetime, 0) and isTime(log_datetime, 11, 20)):
    count += 1

count

I had extracted and uploaded the `data` after extraction using gzip into colab and then executed the script.

The other script:

import pandas as pd
import gzip
import re
import os
from datetime import datetime
import hashlib
from google.colab import files

# Function to compute SHA-256 hash
def compute_hash(text):
    return hashlib.sha256(text.encode()).hexdigest()

# Function to parse Apache log entries

    log_pattern = (r'^(\S+) (\S+) (\S+) \[(.*?)\] "(\S+) (.*?) (\S+)" (\d+) (\S+) "(.*?)" "(.*?)" (\S+) (\S+)$')
    match = re.match(log_pattern, line)
    if match:
        return {
            "ip": match.group(1),
            "time": match.group(4),

        }
    return None

# Upload file

file_path = list(uploaded.keys())[0]  # Get uploaded file name

# Load and parse the log file
def load_logs(file_path):
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        print(f"Error: File '{file_path}' not found.")
        return pd.DataFrame()

    parsed_logs = []
    with gzip.open(file_path, 'rt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        for line in f:
            parsed_entry = parse_log_line(line)
            if parsed_entry:
                parsed_logs.append(parsed_entry)
    return pd.DataFrame(parsed_logs)

# Convert time format
def convert_time(timestamp):
    return datetime.strptime(timestamp, "%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z")

df = load_logs(file_path)

if not df.empty:
    df["datetime"] = df["time"].apply(convert_time)
    df["day_of_week"] = df["datetime"].dt.strftime('%A')
    df["hour"] = df["datetime"].dt.hour

    # Filter conditions
    filtered_df = df[
        (df["method"] == "GET") &
        (df["url"].str.startswith("/telugu/")) &
        (df["status"] >= 200) & (df["status"] < 300) &
        (df["day_of_week"] == "Monday") &
        (df["hour"] >= 11) &
        (df["hour"] < 20)
    ]

    # Compute hash of the result
    result_hash = compute_hash(str(len(filtered_df)))

    # Output the count and hash
    print("Successful GET requests for /telugu/ on Mondays (11:00-7:59 AM):", len(filtered_df))
else:
    print("No log data available for processing.")

Both give the same output: 2698. Please help me identify the error, if any.

can anyone help me ,

**Image: Screenshot 2025-03-31 064538**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web form for "Academic Verification". It appears to be part of a larger application process, possibly for a student discount or access to academic resources. The form includes fields for:

*   First Name
*   Last Name
*   Country (with a dropdown menu)
*   School Name

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Header:** "Your email domain is not currently registered with us. You can choose another verification method."
*   **Section Title:** "Academic Verification"
*   **Instructions:** "Start by entering your name as per the school records. Select your school's country and enter your school's name. Enter your date of birth as per the school records. The email address may be used to reach you if we have trouble verifying your application, so please enter your school provided email address."
*   **Field Labels:** "First name", "Last name", "Country", "School name"
*   **Field Values:**
    *   First name: "VIKASH"
    *   Last name: "PRASAD"
    *   Country: "India"
    *   School name: "Indian Institute Of Technology Madras (Chennai, Tamil Nadu)"
*   **Disclaimer:** "If your country is not listed, the offer is not available in your region. Learn More" (The "Learn More" part is a hyperlink).
*   **School Name Help Text:** "School name will help provide Microsoft with additional information for verification. If available, please enter it here."

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The purpose of the form is to verify the academic affiliation of the user. The initial message indicates that the user's email domain is not recognized, so this form is likely a secondary method of verification. By providing their name, country, and school, the system can attempt to confirm their student status.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The form is likely part of a web application.
*   The "Country" field is implemented as a dropdown select element.
*   The "Learn More" text is a hyperlink, suggesting it leads to a page with more information about regional availability.
*   The form is designed to collect personal information (name) and

**Image: Screenshot 2025-03-31 064552**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a UI element, specifically a text input field within a form. Above the input field is a label.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Label:** "School email address"
*   **Input Field:** "21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image likely represents a part of a registration or profile form where a user is asked to provide their school email address. The input field is pre-filled with an example email address.

**4. Technical details:**

The email address format suggests it's a student email address. The domain "ds.study.iitm.ac.in" indicates that the student is associated with the "ds" (likely a department or program) at "iitm.ac.in" (likely an educational institution). The "21f3002277" part is likely a student ID or a unique identifier.

Hi,

i deployed the application the application in render. It is free for 750 hours per month. But it is saying if the application is inactive mode, it will be go spin-off mode and take some 50 seconds to respond to the first query from inactive mode.

is that ok?

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a section of a user interface (UI) for configuring inbound port rules, likely within a cloud computing platform (possibly Microsoft Azure). It presents options for controlling which network ports of a virtual machine are accessible from the public internet. The UI elements include:

*   A title: "Inbound port rules"
*   Descriptive text explaining the purpose of the section.
*   A radio button group for selecting whether to allow no public inbound ports ("None") or to allow selected ports ("Allow selected ports"). The "Allow selected ports" option is currently selected.
*   A dropdown menu labeled "Select inbound ports" with a selected value of "SSH (22)".
*   An alert message indicating the security implications of the current configuration.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Title:** "Inbound port rules"
*   **Description:** "Select which virtual machine network ports are accessible from the public internet. You can specify more limited or granular network access on the Networking tab."
*   **Label:** "Public inbound ports *" (The asterisk likely indicates a required field.)
*   **Options:** "None", "Allow selected ports"
*   **Label:** "Select inbound ports *" (Also a required field.)
*   **Selected Port:** "SSH (22)"
*   **Alert Message:** "This will allow all IP addresses to access your virtual machine. This is only recommended for testing. Use the Advanced controls in the Networking tab to create rules to limit inbound traffic to known IP addresses."

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The purpose of this UI section is to allow a user to configure the inbound network security rules for a virtual machine. Specifically, it controls which ports on the VM are open to the public internet. The user can choose to block all inbound traffic, or to allow traffic on specific ports.

The alert message highlights a critical security consideration: opening a port to all IP addresses makes the VM vulnerable to attacks from anywhere on the internet. It advises users to use more granular controls (likely available in a separate "Networking" tab) to restrict access to known IP addresses.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **Port 22 (SSH):** The selected port is SSH (Secure Shell), which is commonly used for remote administration of

is the port is correct @Jivraj

Respected Sir,

We kindly request a one-day extension for Project 2, as we finished with vivas and OPPE yesterday only. The circumstances this time have been more challenging than in Project 1, making it difficult to meet the deadline.

We would be extremely grateful if you could consider this request. Your support would be highly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Could you please extend the deadline for Project 2 as today(31/03/2025) is the last day of submission and it clashes with ‚ÄúEid al-Fitr‚Äù. I have small portion of work left but it won‚Äôt be possible as there is frequent visit of guests and friends. Could you please extend the deadline till 02/04/2025, this will give us enough amount of time to complete the project after our festival.

Thank you

@Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @carlton

What is the request timeout for each question, especially for the question on YouTube video transcription? I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription.

For 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer.

So I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation.

Question ‚Äî> the ‚Äúquestion‚Äù sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?

Edit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what‚Äôs taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster.

Regards,

Shivaditya

For the FastAPI type questions, my endpoints are like [http://ip](http://ip):port/endpoint. But while testing using the portal it expects HTTPS instead of http. But nothing of that sort is given in the question. Will the evaluator also expect a https url or is a http url enough for it to hit the endpoint?

q-vercel-python.json will be same or different?

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a text-based interface, likely a code editor or documentation page, with instructions and examples related to deploying a Python application on Vercel. It includes text, code snippets, and URLs.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   "Download this `q-vercel-python.json` which has the marks of 100 imaginary students."
*   "Create and deploy a Python app to `Vercel`. Expose an API so that when a request like `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y` is made, it returns a JSON response with the marks of the names X and Y in the same order, like this:"
*   `{ "marks": [10, 20] }`
*   "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin."
*   "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`"
*   `https://vercel-tds-one.vercel.app/api`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The content appears to be a tutorial or guide for setting up a Python API on Vercel. The API is designed to return a JSON response containing the "marks" of two names (X and Y) passed as parameters in the URL. The guide emphasizes the importance of enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow requests from any origin. It also asks for the Vercel URL.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **JSON Example:** The code snippet `{ "marks": [10, 20] }` shows an example of the JSON response that the API should return. It's a simple JSON object with a single key "marks" whose value is an array containing two numbers (10 and 20).
*   **API Endpoint:** The URL `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y` demonstrates how to call the API. It uses query parameters `name=X` and `name=Y` to pass the names for which the marks are to be retrieved.
*   **Vercel:**

Will the llamafile be same?

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows text instructions and a URL, likely displayed in a terminal or code editor environment. The background is dark, suggesting a dark mode theme.

**2. Text Content:**

The image contains the following text:

*   "Download Llamafile. Run the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6\_K.llamafile model with it."
*   "Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok."
*   "What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/"
*   "https://aafb-2405-201-4007-c068-eb1d-b640-5d42-2493.ngrok-free.app"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image provides instructions for setting up and running a Llamafile model. It involves downloading the model file, creating a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok, and then identifying the ngrok URL. The last line shows an example of what the ngrok URL might look like.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **Llamafile:** This refers to a specific type of file or software related to running large language models (LLMs).
*   **Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6\_K.llamafile:** This is the name of a specific Llamafile model. The "1B" likely indicates that it's a 1 billion parameter model. "Instruct" suggests it's fine-tuned for instruction following. "Q6\_K" likely refers to a specific quantization method used to reduce the model's size.
*   **ngrok:** This is a tool that creates secure tunnels to expose a local server to the internet. It's used here to make the Llamafile server accessible remotely.
*   **ngrok URL:** This is the URL generated by ngrok that allows access to the tunneled server. The example URL "https://[random].ngrok-free.app/" shows the general format, where "[random]" is a randomly generated string. The actual URL provided is "https://aafb-

hello i want to know about this currently I am using approach like you provide HTML page URL and my internal approach and run hidden value or you provide URL website

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a section of a user interface (UI), likely from a web page or application. It includes:

*   Two lines of text forming a question.
*   A text input field (empty).
*   A "Check" button.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   "Just above this paragraph, there's a hidden input with a secret value."
*   "What is the value in the hidden input?"
*   "Check" (on the button)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The context suggests a challenge or puzzle where the user needs to find a hidden input field (likely in the HTML source code of the page) and determine its value. The user then enters the value into the visible input field and clicks "Check" to verify their answer.

**4. Technical details (inferred):**

*   The "hidden input" likely refers to an HTML input element with the `type="hidden"` attribute. This makes the input field invisible on the page but still accessible in the HTML source.
*   The "secret value" is the value assigned to the `value` attribute of the hidden input element.
*   The "Check" button likely triggers a JavaScript function that compares the user's input with the actual value of the hidden input.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a section of a user interface, likely from an interactive coding tutorial or exercise. It presents a challenge related to CSS selectors and data attributes. There's a problem statement, an input field for the user to enter their answer, and a "Check" button.

**2. Text Content:**

*   "Let's make sure you know how to select elements using CSS selectors. Find all ``s having a `foo` class in the hidden element below. What's the sum of their `data-value` attributes?"
*   "Sum of data-value attributes:"
*   "Check"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The purpose of this UI element is to test the user's understanding of CSS selectors and how to access data attributes in HTML elements. The user needs to identify specific `` elements (those with the class "foo") within a hidden section of the page, extract the values of their `data-value` attributes, calculate the sum of these values, and enter the result in the provided input field. Clicking the "Check" button will likely submit the answer for evaluation.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The problem involves CSS selectors, specifically targeting `` elements with a specific class ("foo").
*   It also involves accessing HTML data attributes, which are custom attributes prefixed with "data-" (in this case, "data-value").
*   The user needs to perform a calculation (summation) based on the values of these data attributes.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a description of a SQLite database table named "tickets" and a sample of its data. It also presents a question that requires writing an SQL query.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Description:** "There is a `tickets` table in a SQLite database that has columns `type`, `units`, and `price`. Each row is a customer bid for a concert ticket."
*   **Table Headers:** `type`, `units`, `price`
*   **Table Data (Sample):**
    *   `bronze`, `297`, `0.6`
    *   `Bronze`, `673`, `1.62`
    *   `Silver`, `105`, `1.26`
    *   `Silver`, `82`, `0.79`
    *   `SILVER`, `121`, `0.84`
    *   `...` (Indicates more rows exist)
*   **Question:** "What is the total sales of all the items in the "Gold" ticket type? Write SQL to calculate it."

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image presents a database scenario and a problem to solve using SQL. The context is a table of customer bids for concert tickets, with information about the ticket type, the number of units bid for, and the price per unit. The purpose is to test the user's ability to write an SQL query to calculate the total sales for a specific ticket type ("Gold").

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **Database:** SQLite
*   **Table Name:** `tickets`
*   **Columns:**
    *   `type` (likely a string representing the ticket type, e.g., "Gold", "Silver", "Bronze")
    *   `units` (likely an integer representing the number of tickets)
    *   `price` (likely a floating-point number representing the price per ticket)
*   **SQL Query Required:** The user needs to write an SQL query that filters the `tickets` table for rows where the `type` is "Gold" (case-insensitive), multiplies the `units` and `price` for each row, and then sums up the

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) for an "AI Assignment Solver." It appears to be a web application or a similar tool designed to help users with their assignments. The UI includes elements for uploading files and asking questions.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Title:** "AI Assignment Solver"
*   **Section 1:** "Upload a File"
    *   "Choose File" (button)
    *   "No file chosen" (text indicating no file has been selected)
    *   "Upload" (button)
    *   "No file uploaded." (text indicating no file has been uploaded)
*   **Section 2:** "Ask a Question"
    *   "Enter your question here" (placeholder text in a text input field)
    *   "Submit" (button)
*   **Section 3:** "Answer will appear here." (placeholder text indicating where the answer will be displayed)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The UI suggests that the tool allows users to either upload a file (presumably containing assignment details or relevant information) or directly ask a question. The "AI Assignment Solver" likely uses artificial intelligence to analyze the uploaded file or the question and provide an answer, which will then be displayed in the designated area.

**4. Technical details (based on UI elements):**

*   The UI includes a file upload component with a "Choose File" button, which is a standard HTML form element for selecting files from the user's device.
*   There's a text input field for users to enter their questions.
*   There are "Upload" and "Submit" buttons, which would trigger actions to send the file or question to the AI processing engine.
*   The UI uses placeholder text to guide the user on how to interact with the tool.
*   The overall design is simple and straightforward, with a focus on functionality.
*   The background color is a light purple.

Sir, I have created the frontend app like an html page with the fastapi utilizing the chatgpt-o3 , instead of Api key. I managed to get api keys but ended up in only text mining without file handing (not able to do multipart-form data). So, I have made to use  the model and designed a frontend which also takes the input from the file uploaded, So, it will be ideal for assignment solver, Isn‚Äôt it , Sir? @carlton @Karthik_POD

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a list of numerical values, followed by a calculation and a concluding statement. It appears to be a screenshot of text, possibly from a document or a webpage.

**2. Text Content:**

The text content includes:

*   A list of negative numbers (e.g., "- 2,400.00", "- 0.00", "- 1,234.00", "- 10,000.00", "- 20.00", "- 2,000.00", "- 0.00", "- 0.00", "- 20,03,030.00", "- 1,000.00" repeated several times).
*   The phrase "Now, let's calculate the total:"
*   Another list of negative numbers (e.g., "- 1,233.00", "- 56,767.00", "- 2,400.00", "- 1,234.00", "- 10,000.00", "- 20.00", "- 2,000.00", "- 20,03,030.00", "- 5,000.00 (total of subsequent similar entries)")
*   The phrase "Summing these values:"
*   An addition equation: "1,233.00 + 56,767.00 + 2,400.00 + 1,234.00 + 10,000.00 + 20.00 + 2,000.00 + 2,003,030.00 + 5,000.00 = 2,073,684.00"
*   The concluding statement: "Thus, the total value of complaints is **2,073,684.00**."

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows a calculation of the total value of complaints.

This is the output Sir @carlton @Karthik_POD . Also my project-1 has not been scored .. till now .. Please review that also. [Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread - #240](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/240)

Hi @22f3000370

We appreciate the efforts you have put in. But, for the project we aren‚Äôt expecting a full-stack app with an integrated frontend. We just need an API endpoint on which we would be able to send requests in the given format. For more info check the TDS course page. [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-2)

    *   "Manual Deploy" (button/dropdown)
*   **Service Details:**
    *   "23f3001764 / TDS-Project-2" (likely a repository identifier and service name)
    *   "main" (indicates the branch being used)
    *   "https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com" (the URL of the deployed service)

I have deployed the project on render so the first request in evaluation takes around 50 to 60 second is that okay

I deployed my API using Railway.app, but Jio ISP is blocking requests to `.up.railway.app`. I tested it with five other ISPs, and the API endpoint works perfectly. Could you please consider that some ISPs may be blocking certain domains?

We‚Äôll try to keep this in consideration while developing the evaluation script. But to be on the safer side keep sending requests to your server on such intervals that it doesn‚Äôt go inactive.

@Saransh_Saini @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj

Please extend the deadline for TDS Project 2. The MAD 1 project and two OPPEs have taken up all my time. I have completed my TDS project up to the Week 3 assignment solutions, and only two weeks remain to complete Weeks 4 and 5.

**Image: Description of the GIF**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a cartoon-style illustration of a young man in a pleading pose. He has large, expressive eyes with prominent pupils, a small nose, and rosy cheeks. His hands are clasped together in front of him, as if begging or asking for something. There are small droplets of sweat or tears emanating from his face, suggesting distress or desperation.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The word "PLEASE!" is written in a stylized, slightly tilted font to the right of the character. The text is red and appears to be emphasized.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image is clearly intended to convey a sense of pleading, begging, or asking for a favor. The character's expression, posture, and the word "PLEASE!" all contribute to this message. It's likely used in a context where someone is trying to persuade or implore another person.

**4. Technical details:**

The image is a digital illustration, likely created using vector graphics software. The style is simple and clean, with bold outlines and flat colors. The use of large eyes and exaggerated expressions is typical of cartoon characters designed to evoke emotion. The background is black.

I completely understand the need to keep evaluations on schedule. In that case, would it be possible to grant just a one-day extension? I‚Äôve completed up to Week 3 and just need a little extra time to wrap up Weeks 4 and 5 properly. A single day would really help me submit a more polished project without causing significant delays

I am facing this issue can any one help

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows an error message displayed on a webpage, likely from a web hosting platform like Vercel. It indicates that a serverless function has crashed. The message is structured with different sections to inform the user about the status of their connection, the platform, and the specific error.

**2. Text Content:**

The text content is as follows:

*   "This Serverless Function has crashed."
*   "Your connection is working correctly."
*   "Vercel is working correctly."
*   "500: INTERNAL\_SERVER\_ERROR"
*   "Code: `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED`"
*   "ID: `bom1::48ghr-1743430791127-d99a1b77819a`"
*   "If you are a visitor, contact the website owner or try again later."
*   "If you are the owner, learn how to fix the error and check the logs."

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The purpose of the displayed message is to inform the user (both visitors and the website owner) about an error that occurred while trying to execute a serverless function. It provides information about the error type (500 Internal Server Error), a specific error code (FUNCTION\_INVOCATION\_FAILED), and a unique ID for debugging purposes. It also gives instructions to both visitors and the website owner on what to do next.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **Serverless Function:** This indicates that the application is using a serverless architecture, where code is executed in response to events without the need to manage servers.
*   **500 Internal Server Error:** This is a standard HTTP status code indicating a generic error on the server side.
*   **FUNCTION\_INVOCATION\_FAILED:** This error code suggests that the serverless function failed to execute properly. This could be due to various reasons, such as code errors, missing dependencies, or resource limitations.
*   **ID:** The ID string (`bom1::48ghr-1743430791127-d99a1b77819a`) is likely a unique identifier for the specific

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

This is not a code screenshot or technical diagram. It is an illustration or animation still. The style suggests it's from an anime or cartoon.

I noticed that ngrok disconnects after two hours, so I‚Äôm wondering if we can continue using it.

If your team was aware of this, I‚Äôd like to understand why it was allowed to deploy on ngrok. I typically use Vercel for deployment, but as you know, Vercel doesn‚Äôt support certain features.

Ah, the true mark of a dedicated developer‚Äîwhen even your dreams come with syntax errors!  :laughing:  This project was a rollercoaster of caffeine, code, and existential debugging at 3 AM.

Hello Sir,

I hope you‚Äôre doing well. On behalf of all the students in our course, I wanted to request a deadline extension for the project 2. We‚Äôre all putting in our best effort, but we need a little more time to complete it properly.

If it‚Äôs possible to grant an extension, we would really appreciate it. Please let us know if you can consider this request.

Thank you for your time and understanding!

Please sir  !

The image shows a cat standing on its hind legs. The cat is a Scottish Fold, characterized by its folded ears. It's in a pose that makes it appear thoughtful or contemplative.

**2. Any text content visible:**

There is no text visible in the image.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image is likely intended to be humorous or endearing. The cat's pose and expression suggest it's deep in thought or perhaps plotting something mischievous. It's a common meme format.

**4. Technical details:**

There are no technical details to describe, as it's a photograph of a cat. The background appears to be a wooden floor.

Respected Sir,

I kindly request a deadline extension of at least 3 minutes for the project submission, similar to what was done for ROE. Due to slow internet connectivity and the absence of WiFi, my submission took longer than usual. As a result, I was only able to upload it at 12:01 AM instead of the regular 11:59 PM deadline.

PLEASE Sir, As I‚Äôm a standalone student and this is my primary degree after 12th, please do accept it.

Thank you

The image shows a cartoon character, specifically Tom from the "Tom and Jerry" cartoon series. He is depicted in a kneeling position, with his hands clasped together in front of him, as if he is praying or begging. His eyes are closed, and his facial expression suggests desperation or intense pleading.

**2. Any text content visible:**

There is no text visible in the image.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image likely captures a moment of desperation or supplication from Tom. Given the context of the "Tom and Jerry" cartoons, this could be after a failed attempt to catch Jerry, or perhaps in anticipation of some impending misfortune. The image is intended to be humorous, as Tom's exaggerated expression and posture are typical of the cartoon's slapstick style.

**4. Technical details:**

The image is a still frame from an animated cartoon. The style is consistent with classic animation techniques, with hand-drawn characters and backgrounds. The colors are somewhat muted, which is typical of older cartoons. The background is a simple landscape with a tree and a field.

My project is hosted on render, because vercel refuses to cooperate with me, as a result the free version of render takes a minute to respond, and not only that but might also give internal server error until the 2nd or 3rd try. There is nothing I can do to change this except for maybe sending requests every now and then like it was suggested for another student using render. I just want to know if this is okay for evaluation.

I have a curious question.

I have my project running from azure and code in GitHub repository.

What is stopping me from making further change to my deployment because my end point will be same. Anyway my code checksum for the deployment and GitHub code won‚Äôt match as I haven‚Äôt pushed the token to GitHub.

Thanks,

I reuesting to all my teachers @s.anand, @carlton, @Jivraj, @Saransh_Saini please reply me.

What is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don‚Äôt have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don‚Äôt have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don‚Äôt think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn‚Äôt provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don‚Äôt have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber‚Äôs Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India‚Äôs top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don‚Äôt ask anything.

Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won‚Äôt be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. ". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don‚Äôt ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI‚Äôs or read whatever and wherever you want to read.

It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.

Thankyou to all my respected ‚ÄòThe Great Teachers‚Äô.

hi,

I dont share your views.

i feel it was one of the best course in whole of Diploma.

I have learned a lot in these projects and even in ROE preparation.

all the things we are learning here are open in market and the course contents are great direction towards learning and practicing them.

I agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other.

but at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things.

Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc‚Ä¶ At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify

for GA‚Äôs: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections

All in all I am happy with the course.

Dear Shahzada,

You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)

The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.

 23f2002668:

What is this going on? Is it joking?

I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.

 23f2002668:

Our teachers don‚Äôt have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?

We have made **several hours of videos** on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.

 23f2002668:

I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.

Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)

 23f2002668:

They explained what should be your approach? How to make project?

Yes these were explained if you

either took part in any live session or
watched the recorded video

 23f2002668:

And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?

I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.

 23f2002668:

It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.

Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:

Create a server api that receives a request.

The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.

The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.

Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.

 23f2002668:

Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?

Since this is your first post, you‚Äôve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.

If you want solutions, there are several options:

Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)
Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)
Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)
Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)

 23f2002668:

They don‚Äôt have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.

This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.

The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs‚Ä¶ with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.

 23f2002668:

Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India‚Äôs top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.

If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.

But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.

What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.

I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.

 23f2002668:

They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don‚Äôt ask anything.

Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. **Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.**  Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.

Now is a good time to start.

 23f2002668:

Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won‚Äôt be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. "

That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.

 23f2002668:

I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?

They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.

**Luckily for you,** our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).

 23f2002668:

The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.

If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.

 23f2002668:

In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.

Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?

Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.

But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.

You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.

 23f2002668:

It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.

Thankyou to all my respected ‚ÄòThe Great Teachers‚Äô.

I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither `respect` nor `kindness` is evident in your post.

But thank you for your feedback.

One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.

And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.

Kind regards,

TDS team

Hi, I have a few things to say

My background :

I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.

My Initial Disappointments with this Course

In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):

The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.

Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn‚Äôt like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph
ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.
There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.

Why did I fail?
Last Term

I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn‚Äôt practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.

This term.

I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn‚Äôt allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn‚Äôt submit both the projects.

In both the terms I didn‚Äôt collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn‚Äôt earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.

Me Understanding about the Course Now

This one line changed my view about ROE.

[On another topic](/t/99838/2)

**What does this RoE evaluate?** Implicit learning.

I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don‚Äôt know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.

I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.

Now I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.

In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing `SKLearn`. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.

This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an ***implicit*** way.

This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.

I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks

I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.

I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.

From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn‚Äôt do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn‚Äôt cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.

Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.

Thanks to @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj  and @Saransh_Saini

Just two suggestions

I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.
While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.

Hello Carlton,

When are you guys likely to test the API endpoints for Project 2?

I have hosted it on Microsoft Azure, and I only have $92 left out of the free $100 credit. It would be great if you could do this within a week. It is decreasing rapidly.

@parthivn28 @Harshjayswal-2003 @23f2004912

Evaluations will start before this weekend, with some sampling done possibly even tonight and most evaluation runs tomorrow.

Also we will prime the target first by sending a dummy request so it gets ‚Äúwarmed up‚Äù because some of you have reported time to respond to first request takes time for the server to spin up.

Then once we know its responding, we will send requests for evaluation.

Kind regards

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir, I have noticed that sometimes our vm based application gets stuck and on verifying every request using FastApi have noticed that best way to check is run and get your answer post that RESET it back and then run another query and it works perfectly fine, not sure have other faced this issue or not, but it would be great if you could take note of this while evaluating just for safety.

Hope you take note of this and take this into consideration.

Thanks & Regards,

Digvijaysinh Chudasama

Okay so basically sometimes what happens is while verifying on FASTApi ‚Äì it gives errors like missing paramaters like‚Ä¶ So basically sometimes it needs resetting the request parser and then it works perfectly fine.

{
  "detail": "execute() missing 1 required positional argument: 'file_bytes'"
}

Which is incorrect, so if we press the RESET button and execute it works properly.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. UI Elements:**

*   The image shows a web form, likely part of an API testing or documentation tool.
*   It has a "Parameters" section at the top, indicating that the form is used to define input parameters for an API request.
*   There are "Cancel" and "Reset" buttons at the top right.
*   A "Request body" section is present, marked as "required".
*   Within the request body, there are two input fields: "question" and "file".
*   The "question" field is a text input.
*   The "file" field is a file upload field with a "Choose File" button.
*   There's a checkbox labeled "Send empty value" associated with the file field.
*   An "Execute" button is present, along with a "Clear" button.
*   Sections for "Responses" and "Curl" are visible at the bottom.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Headers:** "Parameters", "Request body", "Responses", "Curl"
*   **Labels:** "question", "file", "Send empty value"
*   **Input Field Placeholders/Values:**
    *   "Download and use multi-cursors and convert it into a single" (in the "question" field)
    *   "q-multi-cursor-json.txt" (next to the "Choose File" button, indicating a file has been selected)
*   **Buttons:** "Cancel", "Reset", "Execute", "Clear", "Choose File"
*   **Other Text:** "required" (next to "Request body" and "question"), "string", "(string | null) ($binary)", "No parameters", "multipart/form-data"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

*   The form is designed to allow a user to construct an API request.
*   The "Request body" section indicates that the API endpoint expects data to be sent in the request body.
*   The "multipart/form-data" selection suggests that the API expects data to be sent as a multipart form, which is commonly used for file uploads.
*   The "question" field likely represents a text-based query or instruction.
*   The "file" field allows

Correct output image ‚Äì

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a UI element displaying a server response. It's structured as a table with columns for "Code" and "Details."  Within the "Details" column, there are sections for "Response body" and "Response headers." The "Response body" section contains a JSON object. There are also download buttons.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Headers:** "Server response," "Code," "Details," "Response body," "Response headers"
*   **Code:** "200"
*   **JSON Object:**
    ```json
    {
    "answer": "7a5955793fe63e199d0677d33f0053c50110d66589253280b1be96c598df24d8"
    }
    ```
*   **Button:** "Download"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows the response from a server, likely after an API request. The "Code" 200 indicates a successful request. The "Response body" contains the data returned by the server, which in this case is a JSON object with a single key "answer" and a long string value. The "Download" button suggests the user can download the response data.

**4. Technical details (JSON):**

*   The JSON object has a single key-value pair.
*   The key is "answer".
*   The value is a long string that appears to be a hexadecimal string (likely a hash or ID). It consists of alphanumeric characters (0-9 and a-f). The length of the string is 64 characters. This is a common length for SHA-256 hashes.

Hope you get my point which i‚Äôm trying to convey sir.

Just a brother trying to help students gain valuable skills.

Nothing more brother.

The success of students‚Äô future, is the best reward.

Sometimes it takes a bit longer because some lessons are harder than others. And we all make mistakes. But if you‚Äôve learnt something valuable on the journey, then you are better prepared for what comes next regardless of whether you could clear the obstacle the first time or not.

Kindest regards,

The way we test your api is **not through a front end.**

We send a request to the endpoint directly. We have demoed it in live sessions.

We have even posted on discourse snippets of what this looks like.

As long as your endpoint responds to a request that we send, it will be fine.

Kind regards

Dear @Carlton and @S.Anand,

I successfully deployed my project on Vercel, and it works perfectly when tested using curl commands. Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel‚Äôs free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project‚Äôs size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.

Could you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue? I would greatly appreciate your guidance, as I fear all my hard work might go to waste without a resolution.

We are in the processing pipeline. You will have to wait till it completes. Basically if your endpoint works when we send it a request you will be evaluated. We will use the timestamp of your latest endpoint before the deadline.

Hope that answers your question.

The alternative is to use vercel purely as an endpoint service that processes most things without large libraries, and for more heavy duty backend work forwards the request to another system that handles it and sends it back to your vercel function which then relays the answer to the request.

in spreadsheet edit response modify previous response with timestamp, how you can access that timestamp response?? So how can u have my end point before deadline one since i updated it after deadline.

Also the before deadline one end point is

/api which i changed to /api/ after deadline so if u somehow have access to my old url pls consider adding 1 (slash) / :')

 :graduation_cap:  From Problem to Platform: Building ‚ÄúVicky‚Äù ‚Äì A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras

 :rocket:  **Project Demo Website**: [https://app.algsoch.tech](https://app.algsoch.tech)

During our college course *Tool for Data Science (TDS)* at **IIT Madras**, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: **to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API**.

 :brain:  The Mission:

Create a tool that behaves like a **chatbot**, accepts **user queries (text or file-based)** via **web or API**, processes them intelligently, **executes the appropriate code**, and returns accurate results‚Äîlike a real data science assistant.

 :counterclockwise_arrows_button:  The Journey: From Fails to Final

At first, the natural choice was to try **LLM agents**‚Äîthey sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries.  :cross_mark: 

Then I thought‚Äîwhat if I manually mapped questions and answers using a **static JSON structure**? That quickly broke when users passed **different parameters, different files**, or queried in **non-standard formats** like ‚Äúcode -s‚Äù or ‚Äúcode -v‚Äù.

The next idea: write **individual Python scripts per question** from our Graded Assignments (GA1‚ÄìGA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable.  :cross_mark: 

 :wrench:  The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping

After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:

 :white_check_mark:  Centralized engine in `vicky_server.py`

 :white_check_mark:  Uses **regex-based pattern matching** to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution

 :white_check_mark:  Each solution is a structured Python function like `ga1_first_solution(query=None)`

 :white_check_mark:  Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more

 :white_check_mark:  Acts like a **mini compiler for data science tools**

 :globe_with_meridians:  Presenting Vicky ‚Äì The Mini Chatbot for TDS  :fire: 

Vicky is a **smart, modular chatbot** built specifically for **Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras**. It‚Äôs packed with real functionality‚Äînot just templates.

Key Features:

 :brain:  **Graded Assignment Solver**

Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:

`code -s` / `code -v` ‚Üí VS terminal commands
Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching
GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup
Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression

 :open_file_folder:  **File Upload with Query Matching**

Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file.

 :globe_showing_europe_africa:  **HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder**

View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy
Upload Base64 string ‚Üí Get original image back

 :robot:  **Webhooks Integration**

Live notifications via **Discord** & **Slack** whenever `/api` endpoints are accessed
Monitors **server status (online/offline)** and sends real-time updates

 :spouting_whale:  **LLM Download + Auto Tunneling**

Downloads LLaMA models
Dynamically finds available ports
Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints

 :chart_increasing:  **Live Web UI at [app.algsoch.tech](https://app.algsoch.tech)**

Ask any TDS question
Upload and query with files
Image decoder
Graded assignment slider navigation
HTML viewer
API health status

 :man_technologist:  Built With:

**FastAPI** for blazing fast APIs
**Regex & Pattern Matching** for dynamic input detection
**GitHub Copilot** + my Python debugging and architectural thinking
Full webhook and status monitoring system
Modular backend (`vicky_server.py`) and web frontend (`vicky_app.py`)

I want to extend a huge thank you to @s.anand for their guidance on this project. I‚Äôve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won‚Äôt replace our jobs‚Äîespecially for those who understand programming‚Äîthey will create new job opportunities instead.

Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project

Dear Sir,

I would like to clarify the situation regarding my previous submission. Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart.

I hope you will consider my case. I submitted my work at that time because I learned about this solution from a fellow student on Discord. I only changed the URL and made no other modifications.

Thank you for your understanding

Hi @carlton

The same issue has affected several of us. During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to @Saransh_Saini.

It seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs.

We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.

We hope this won‚Äôt be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.

Thank you

Lakshay

Dear Sir @carlton,

Sir, please note that after the deadline I haven‚Äôt resubmitted the form but I have edited it (as the form was allowing editing till then). Now what exactly have I edited is just added a ‚Äú/‚Äù at the end and that‚Äôs it and nothing more. Highlighting it again, I haven‚Äôt resubmitted the form but edited it on the very next morning after the deadline.

So now my question is: My edited response will be accepted right in this case?

Sir, please throw some light on my doubt.

Warm Regards,

Tensed TDS Student

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

**Image: Screenshot 2025-04-05 232353**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal window with log entries. The entries appear to be from a web server or application, logging HTTP requests and their responses. The terminal prompt indicates a user logged into a system named "TDS".

**2. Text Content:**

The log entries follow a consistent format:

*   **Date and Time:** (e.g., "Apr 05 14:19:25")
*   **Source:** "TDS python [79249]" - likely indicating a Python process named TDS with process ID 79249.
*   **Log Level:** "INFO:" or "WARNING:"
*   **IP Address and Port:** (e.g., "162.243.238.100:0") - The IP address making the request.
*   **HTTP Request:** (e.g., `"GET /t4 HTTP/1.0"`) - The HTTP method (GET, POST, PROPFIND), the requested path, and the HTTP version.
*   **HTTP Status Code and Message:** (e.g., "404 Not Found", "200 OK", "405 Method Not Allowed")

Some specific URLs being requested include:

*   `/t4`
*   `/favicon.ico`
*   `/` (root)
*   `/teorema505?t=1`
*   `/.env`
*   `/autodiscover/autodiscover.json?@zdi/Powershell`
*   `/.git/config`
*   `/actuator/health`
*   `/logincheck`

The terminal prompt at the bottom reads: `azureuser@TDS:~$`

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image likely shows a system administrator or developer monitoring the logs of a web server or application. The logs provide information about incoming requests, the resources being accessed, and the server's responses.

@carlton I‚Äôm noticing frequent requests from globally scattered IPs‚Äîmostly from cloud or bulletproof hosts like DigitalOcean, Contabo, and Azure‚Äîtargeting sensitive paths like `/t4`, `/logincheck`, `/.env`, and `/.git/config`. These include IPs from places like New York (162.243.238.100), London (34.89.64.89), Amsterdam (45.148.10.172), Moscow (84.201.151.18), Jaipur (103.175.163.104), and Vilnius (85.255.108.243). It really seems like automated vulnerability scanning or botnet activity. Carlton, what can I do??

The evaluation script is ready and the evaluations are going on. So have no worries, your $75 are enough to carry out several evaluations.

Also a better evaluation strat would be to submit the GitHub repo in the form(Else they can make changes to the repo, who checks the commit history?) and maybe conduct a 2 min demo where the student clones the repo and then you run the script?

I know many students are there but other subjects do it for project courses?

Maybe a helpful tip for next time

If i do fail and repeat this course. Hopefully not XD

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I too faced the same issue, I received a bunch of hits from random ip addresses and it got shut down.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-04-06 at 12.37.36 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a text-based log output, likely from a server or application. The log entries are formatted with a prefix indicating the log level (INFO or WARNING), followed by details about HTTP requests and server status.

**2. Text Content:**

The log entries contain the following types of information:

*   **Log Level:** "INFO:" or "WARNING:" indicating the severity of the log message.
*   **IP Address and Port:**  IP addresses and port numbers (e.g., "104.234.115.27:34430") indicating the source of the HTTP request.
*   **HTTP Request:**  The HTTP method (mostly "GET", but also "POST") and the requested URL path (e.g., "GET / HTTP/1.1").
*   **HTTP Status Code:** "404 Not Found" indicating that the requested resource was not found on the server.
*   **Server Status Messages:** "Shutting down", "Waiting for application shutdown", "Application shutdown complete.", "Finished server process [1320]".
*   **Invalid HTTP request received.**

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The log output suggests that a server is receiving HTTP requests, many of which are resulting in "404 Not Found" errors. This could indicate:

*   **Broken links:** Clients are requesting URLs that no longer exist on the server.
*   **Malicious activity:** Someone is probing the server for known vulnerabilities or trying to access sensitive files (e.g., ".env.bak", "/admin/login.asp").
*   **Misconfigured server:** The server might not be properly configured to handle certain requests.
*   **Server Shutdown:** The log also shows the server is shutting down gracefully.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **HTTP Methods:** The log shows "GET" requests, which are used to retrieve data, and a "POST" request, which is used to send data to the server.
*   **HTTP Status Codes:** The "404 Not Found" status code is a standard HTTP response indicating that the server could not find the requested resource.
*   **URL Paths:** The URL paths in the log provide clues about the

I started it once again. Can you please reevaluate it now if it hasn‚Äôt been done yet. I actually tested it till 3rd of April and it was working fine. I don‚Äôt know what actually happened. Please do consider.

Actually in the free tier there are many issues. These issues are beyond our control and I request the TDS team to please consider this issue and please consider re-evaluating it if it has not been done yet as we had put in a lot of efforts.

They are malicious probes. A global cyber war is going on. So anything that can be compromised is being probed.

@Carlton, I believe you all have evaluated it. For me, there are some requests from a known IP with the following location details:

{'status': 'success', 'country': 'India', 'countryCode': 'IN', 'region': 'TN', 'regionName': 'Tamil Nadu', 'city': 'Chennai', 'zip': '600042', 'lat': 13.0895, 'lon': 80.2739, 'timezone': 'Asia/Kolkata', 'isp': 'IIT Madras', 'org': 'IITM', 'as': 'AS141340 IIT Madras', 'query': '103.158.43.17'}

This request was made at 4:38:19 IST.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-04-06 170305**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal window with a dark background. It displays log entries and a command prompt.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Log Entries:** The log entries follow a consistent format:
    *   `Apr 06` (Date)
    *   `10:10:28` or `11:08:19` (Time)
    *   `TDS` (Likely a service or component name)
    *   `python [79249]` (Indicates the process is a Python script with process ID 79249)
    *   `INFO:` (Log level)
    *   `103.158.43.17:0` (IP address and port)
    *   `-` (Separator)
    *   `"GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.0"` or `"POST /api HTTP/1.0"` (HTTP request details)
    *   `200 OK` (HTTP status code and message)

*   **Command Prompt:**
    *   `azureuser@TDS:~$` (Indicates the current user is "azureuser" on a host named "TDS", and the current directory is the home directory "~")

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The image likely shows server logs related to HTTP requests. The logs indicate that a Python application (possibly a web server) is receiving requests. The log entries show the date, time, service, process ID, log level, IP address of the client, the type of HTTP request (GET or POST), the requested URL, the HTTP protocol version, and the HTTP status code. The command prompt indicates that the user is logged into a system named "TDS" as "azureuser".

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The logs show both `GET` and `POST` requests.
    *   `GET /favicon.ico`: A request to retrieve the website's favicon (small icon).
    *   `POST /api`: A request to send data to an API endpoint.
*   **HTTP Status Code:** `200 OK` indicates that the requests were successful.

@Saransh_Saini - This is 24f1001631

The same thing has happened to me as the mentioned above. I also have not received request from Indian IP as far as I can see on the logs. I am using the azure VM itself.

I rechecked and maybe the server went offline, so I re-ran the script anyway and checked a few questions now and it works.

I think after a certain while it timed out for me(not entirely sure tho)‚Ä¶ but i fixed it.

The request includes two parameters in the "form-data" body: a "question" (likely a text query) and a "file" (a JSON file named "q-clean-up-sales-data (7).json"). The API responds with a JSON object containing an "answer" with the value "10887".

The purpose is likely to test an API endpoint that processes a question and a data file, and returns a numerical answer.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **HTTP Method:** POST, indicating that the request is likely creating or

Create a shell script that loops through the list of API endpoints and uses `curl` to send requests to each. You can pass headers, authentication tokens, or data as needed.

Hi sir, just wanted to know when will the results be released. And also in the image I attached it I think shows five different scores for each questions you asked through curl. Is that the mark for each questions and total mark should be considered?

also want to know if we need to do any extra projects for the bonus marks.

thank you

Hello,

I wanted to provide an update regarding the issue I faced while I was in Jammu. During my stay, my laptop was on, but I encountered an error that caused my endpoint to crash. It seemed that Cloudflared mentioned needing an update, which I believe contributed to the problem.

Now that I‚Äôm back in Delhi, I‚Äôm connected to the internet, and I‚Äôm happy to report that my endpoint is working again.

see this image I have designed my endpoint to monitor with discord webhook

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. UI Elements:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of a dashboard or monitoring interface, likely for a software application or service.
*   It has a dark background.
*   There are list-like sections with bullet points.
*   There's an image of the IMDb logo.
*   There's an alert message at the bottom.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **"Total requests: 39"**
*   **"IP addresses:"**
    *   "43.230.106.157: 39 requests"
*   **"Recent queries:"**

*   **"IMDb"**
*   **"Advanced search"**
*   The IMDb logo is present.

*   **"API is DOWN"**
*   "Status: DOWN"
*   "Last checked: 2025-04-07 13:01:32"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

*   The dashboard is likely providing information about the usage and status of an API or application.
*   The "Total requests" and "IP addresses" sections give an overview of traffic.
*   "Recent queries" shows what the application has been processing.
*   The "Prompt to Yes" section suggests the system is being used to answer questions or fulfill requests based on data from sources like ESPN Cricinfo and IMDb.

@Saransh_Saini

Sir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format ‚Äúhttps://‚Ä¶/api/‚Äù and allows only POST requests.

The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response
When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests

a. http://‚Ä¶/api/ ‚Üí resulted in 302 response

b. https://‚Ä¶/api  ‚Üí resulted in a 307

whereas the url I gave was of the format ‚Äúhttps://‚Ä¶/api/‚Äù

The logs from Cloud Run

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a log or network activity monitor. It shows a series of HTTP requests and responses, along with associated metadata like timestamps, IP addresses, HTTP methods, status codes, data sizes, and response times.

**2. Text Content:**

The text content is structured in rows, with each row representing a log entry. Here's a breakdown of the typical fields:

*   **Timestamp:**  `2025-04-05 23:51:12.872` (example).  Indicates the date and time of the event.
*   **Log Level:** `INFO:` or an exclamation mark icon indicating a warning or error.
*   **IP Address and Port:** `169.254.169.126:49510` (example).  The IP address and port number of the client making the request.
*   **HTTP Request:** `"POST /api HTTP/1.1"` or `"GET /api/ HTTP/1.1"` (examples).  Shows the HTTP method (POST or GET), the path being requested (`/api`), and the HTTP version.
*   **HTTP Status Code:** `307`, `302`, `405`, `200` (examples).  Indicates the status of the HTTP response.
*   **Status Text:** `Temporary Redirect`, `Method Not Allowed`
*   **Data Size:** `140 B`, `156 B` (examples).  The size of the data transferred in bytes.
*   **Response Time:** `0 ms`, `1 ms`, `2 ms`, `509 ms` (examples).  The time taken to receive the response.
*   **Client/Library:** `python-reque...`, `python-httpx...` (examples).  Indicates the library or client used to make the request.
*   **URL:** `http://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/` or `https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia

As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with ‚Äú/api‚Äù instead of ‚Äú/api/‚Äù, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below).

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web form, likely a Google Form or similar survey/submission interface. It consists of a title and several question prompts with associated input fields. The form is divided into sections, each with a light purple background.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Title:** "TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025"
*   **Instructions/Information:**
    *   "Please log in with your iitm.ac.in or your work email ID."
    *   "You can submit only one response."
    *   "You can correct your response after you submit."
    *   "Your email (22f3000819@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was recorded when you submitted this form."
*   **Question 1:** "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2? *"
    *   "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name"
    *   **Answer:** "https://github.com/RichPerspective007/tds\_p2"
*   **Question 2:** "What is the link to your API endpoint? *"
    *   "Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL"
    *   **Answer:** "https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The form is designed to collect information related to a project called "TDS Project 2," due in January 2025. Specifically, it's gathering the GitHub repository link containing the project's code and the URL of the project's API endpoint. The asterisk (*) next to each question indicates that these are required fields. The form is likely used for grading or evaluation purposes. The email address associated with the submission is from the "iitm.ac.in" domain, suggesting it's related to the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **GitHub Repository Link:** The example GitHub link "https://github.com/user-name/repository-name" indicates

I request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.

Thank you.

Regards,

Shivaditya

My IITM student dashboard on the portal shows absent for course project (COURSE PROJET - Absent). Is this referring to project 1 or 2? Coz i missed Project 1 but submitted Project 2 successfully. Also the logs show that the evaluation was performed on the submitted enpoint. So should I be concerned about the dashboard showing ‚ÄòAbsent‚Äô or will it be updated in a few days?

We cant specify a clear deadline. If we could we would. At the present time there are roughly 100+ evals left in the pipeline. And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable.

This is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained)

@carlton Could you clarify if some kind of a normalisation will be done this time as well? Or if some bonus marks will be given? Last time, it didn‚Äôt help as much because the highest marks were 16.

sir i am unable to work with other things on my laptop

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a standard error message page, likely from a web browser. It features a simple, cartoon-style icon of a file folder with "X" marks for eyes, indicating a problem.

**2. Text Content:**

The following text is visible:

*   "Aw, Snap!" - This is the main title of the error message.
*   "Something went wrong while displaying this webpage." - This is a brief explanation of the problem.
*   "Error code: Out of Memory" - This specifies the type of error encountered.
*   "Learn more" - This is a hyperlink, presumably leading to a page with more information about the error.

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The image represents an error page displayed by a web browser when it encounters a problem rendering a webpage. The specific error, "Out of Memory," suggests that the browser ran out of available memory while trying to load or process the page. The "Learn more" link is intended to provide the user with troubleshooting steps or further details about the error.

**4. Technical Details:**

The error code "Out of Memory" indicates that the browser was unable to allocate enough memory to complete the rendering of the webpage. This can be caused by a number of factors, including:

*   A webpage with excessive memory requirements (e.g., large images, complex JavaScript).
*   Too many tabs or applications running simultaneously, consuming available memory.
*   A memory leak in the browser or a webpage.
*   Insufficient system memory.

because laptop giving error because my system ran out of memory and because api working continuously more than 1 week

@carlton @Saransh_Saini

This is a gentle reminder to kindly send the confirmation email indicating for whom the evaluation of Project 2 has been completed.

Additionally, I would like to confirm whether we can shut down our Azure VM after this, or if we should keep it running in case there is an additional evaluation. In one of the sessions, you had mentioned the possibility of offering alternate questions as a second chance for students, evaluated at half the original marking scheme (i.e., 2 marks per question).

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) for debugging or monitoring a serverless function, likely hosted on a platform like Vercel. It displays logs, function invocation details, and deployment information. The UI is divided into two main sections:

*   **Left Side:** Displays logs related to function executions.
*   **Right Side:** Shows details about a specific function invocation, including its route, location, runtime, resource usage, and deployment information.

**2. Text Content:**

Here's a breakdown of the text content visible in the image:

*   **Timestamps and Log Entries:**
    *   `APR 09 00:11:06.94 POST 504 tds-ga-proj2.ve... /api/` (Indicates a POST request to the `/api/` endpoint resulting in a 504 error)
    *   `APR 09 00:11:00.79 POST 307 tds-ga-proj2.ve... /api` (Indicates a POST request to the `/api` endpoint resulting in a 307 response)
    *   `No more logs to show within selected timeline`
    *   `Logs 3 Total`
    *   `Vercel Function`
    *   `00:11:07.064 Email ID 23f1000598@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
    *   `00:11:07.112 Email updated in index.html`
    *   `00:11:07.149 Failed to trigger workflow: 401 - {"message": "Bad credentials", "documentation_url":"https://docs.github.com/rest", "status":"401"}`
*   **Function Invocation Details:**
    *   `Firewall Allowed`
    *   `Function Invocation Gateway Timeout 504`
    *   `Route /main.py`
    *   `Location Washington, D.C., USA (iad1)`
    *   `Runtime Python 3.12`

Hello @Saransh_Saini , @Jivraj

Sir When i test it locally , my LLM is working fine , even running the app , it gave result in 2 sec ,

I dont know what happened in the logs , it was showing some runtime error ,

As i am using free plan of vercel , so it allow for 10 sec only ,

I think any heavy file being run , so it just take some more time , more than 10 sec , but inbuild feature of free plan allow to run only 10 sec ‚Ä¶ and thats why this happened , i guess

does it means , my LLM failed ??

Can you please try some other question , it will work , or even for heavy question it work ,

You can check its working from interface too

Please check once !!

We will be sending out emails to both sets. Ones who have to keep it on and ones who can shut it down. If you have not received a shutdown notice, assume that you have to keep it on. I apologise for the late reply, we ran into some unforeseen problems, hence the delay.

@Saransh_Saini  @carlton sir today I received this email

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a text-based message, likely an email or announcement. It's formatted as a letter or notification.

**2. Text Content:**

The text content is as follows:

*   "Dear Learner,"
*   "Please do not ignore this important announcement. We are still doing some checks on the server endpoints for your TDS Project 2."
*   "If you have turned it off because you were told that evaluations were complete, please turn them back on."
*   "We apologise for the inconvenience caused. We aim to complete the evaluations as soon as possible and are cognizant that some of you are using up credits on azure and other platforms to keep them up and running."
*   "We will inform you in subsequent emails when your evaluation is complete so that you do not have to keep them up and running longer than necessary."
*   "--"
*   "Kind regards"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The message is an announcement to learners regarding a project (TDS Project 2). It seems that evaluations were thought to be complete, and some learners may have turned off their servers or resources. The announcement informs them that checks are still being done and asks them to turn their resources back on. It also acknowledges that some learners are using cloud credits (like Azure) to keep their resources running and assures them that they will be notified when the evaluation is truly complete to avoid unnecessary costs.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The message refers to "server endpoints" and "TDS Project 2," suggesting a technical or software development context.
*   The mention of "azure and other platforms" indicates that the project involves cloud computing resources.
*   The term "evaluations" likely refers to automated tests or assessments of the project's functionality.
*   The message implies that learners are responsible for managing their own cloud resources for the project.

I have did not turned it off it is just that the first request take time of 50 to 60 sec as you can see in the image.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of the Postman application, a tool used for testing APIs. It displays a request configuration and the response received.

**2. Text Content Visible:**

*   **Tabs:** "Params", "Authorization", "Headers (9)", "Body", "Pre-request Script", "Tests", "Settings", "Cookies", "Test Results"
*   **Query Params:** "Key", "Value" (repeated twice)
*   **Body:** "Pretty", "Raw", "Preview", "JSON"
*   **JSON Body:**
    *   `{`
    *   `"answer": "140"`
    *   `}`
*   **Status:** "Status: 200 OK Time: 53.13 s Size: 361 B"
*   **Other UI elements:** "Save", "No Environment", "Send", "Code", "Cookie"
*   **Request Type:** "POST"
*   **Request URL:** `https://tds-pro...` (partially obscured)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows a user configuring a POST request in Postman. The user has likely sent the request and received a response. The response body is displayed in JSON format, containing a single key-value pair: `"answer": "140"`. The status code "200 OK" indicates that the request was successful. The time taken for the request was 53.13 seconds, and the size of the response was 361 bytes.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **HTTP Method:** POST
*   **Status Code:** 200 (OK) - Indicates a successful request.
*   **Response Time:** 53.13 seconds
*   **Response Size:** 361 bytes
*   **Response Format:** JSON
*   **JSON Structure:** The JSON response is a simple object with one key, "answer", and its corresponding value, "140". This suggests the API endpoint is returning a numerical answer as a string.
*   **Headers:** The "Headers (9)" tab indicates that there are 9 HTTP headers associated with the request or response.
*   

and it also take same time in linux

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a terminal window, likely on a Linux or macOS system. It displays command-line interactions, specifically a `curl` command and its output.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Command:**
    ```
    curl -X POST "..."/api/" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "question=Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel) =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 5, 2), 1, 10)) What is the result?"
    ```
*   **Output:**
    ```
    {"answer":"140"}
    ```
*   **Prompt:**
    ```
    sahil@DESKTOP-N2T75TO:~$
    ```

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows a user (sahil) interacting with an API endpoint using the `curl` command. The user is sending a POST request to an API endpoint (the URL is partially redacted). The request includes a "question" field, which contains a prompt about Google Sheets formulas. The prompt asks the user to evaluate a specific formula: `SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 5, 2), 1, 10))`. The API responds with a JSON object containing the "answer": "140".

The purpose seems to be testing the user's ability to understand and evaluate Google Sheets formulas, specifically those involving `SEQUENCE`, `ARRAY_CONSTRAIN`, and `SUM`. The API is likely designed to receive such questions and return the correct answer.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **`curl`:**  A command-line tool used to make HTTP requests.
*   **`-X POST`:** Specifies that the request method is POST.
*   **`"..."/api/"`:** The target API endpoint (partially redacted).
*   **`-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"`:** Sets the Content-Type header to `multipart/form-data`, indicating that the request

**Please allow some time for my server hosted on Render to initialize, as it may take a moment to become fully active.**

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Humble Request to Update API Request Link

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I‚Äôm reaching out to kindly ask if it would be possible to update my API request link for project 2 in TDS. I realized that I mistakenly used the wrong endpoint in my earlier request.

**Previous API Request Link:**

      [project2llm-production.up.railway.app](https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/docs)

[IITM Assignment API - Swagger UI](https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/docs)

**Correct API Request Link:**

[https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/](https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/)

[https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/](https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/)

Would it be possible for you to allow me to make this change, or kindly update the link on my behalf? I sincerely apologize for the confusion, and I‚Äôd be truly grateful for your support and understanding.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,

Pratyush Pulak Nishhank

But Sir please give some bonus , As in earlier terms , everyone got S grade in TDS , without doing anything , and from this term the difficulty level increased rapidly , just like e^x

Although I know that our LLM doesnt worked fully(100%) , but atleast they worked 50-60%

We have learned so many things  and try to implement in it too,‚Ä¶

Atleast give some bonus for our hardwork , and participating in both LLM project , so even we dont get S grade , but will get B , A , grade ‚Ä¶ and our CGPA doesn‚Äôt decrease much

because projects hold the major chunk in grading

@carlton,@Saransh_Saini

sir my roll number is 23f2004462

Due to an unexpected power outage, my PC shut down abruptly, causing my local server and ngrok tunnel to terminate. When the system rebooted, I restarted the server and ngrok, which generated a new API endpoint as ngrok URLs are temporary and change with every session. The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint. I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrok‚Äôs paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding.

@carlton @Saransh_Saini  Respected sir, by mistake I have submitted the endpoint as : [https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/](https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/) while the corrected api which is deployed on vercel for direct requests is : [https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/](https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/)

The link provided is also working one but this link has the frontend part not the url endpoint.

kindly evaluate me on the basis of the updated link :  [https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/](https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/)

I think my endpoint has been evaluated, given how POST requests stopped after 3pm. Do I still have to keep it on perhaps through overnight, my laptop now has started to heat up. @Jivraj sir any updates whether my evaluation is completed or not ?.

I kindly request,  if you could please consider reevaluating my assignment. This small error was not reflective of the overall functionality, and I‚Äôm worried that the resulting grade might significantly impact my performance and cause me failing  in the course.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-04-09 211535**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows an email displayed in an email client interface (likely Gmail or a similar service). The email is titled "[TDS Jan 25] Project 2 Announcement". The interface includes standard email controls like print, new window, star, reply, and more options.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Subject:** \[TDS Jan 25] Project 2 Announcement
*   **Sender:** 22t1 se2002
*   **Recipient:** to bcc: me
*   **Email Body:**
    *   "Dear Learner,"
    *   "We have successfully completed your evaluations on Project 2 endpoints. You may switch off your server now. You will receive a score for your Project 2 as soon as all other evaluations are completed."
    *   "Thanks"
    *   "--"
    *   "Kind regards,"
    *   "TDS Team"
*   **Timestamp:** 2:28 AM (18 hours ago)
*   **Inbox label:** Inbox x

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The email is an announcement to a "Learner" (likely a student or participant in a training program) that their evaluations on "Project 2 endpoints" have been successfully completed. The learner is instructed to switch off their server and informed that they will receive a score for Project 2 once all evaluations are completed. The email is sent by the "TDS Team".

**4. Technical details:**

There are no technical diagrams or code snippets in the image. The email mentions "Project 2 endpoints" and "server," suggesting a technical context, possibly related to software development, data science, or a similar field where projects involve servers and endpoints. The instruction to "switch off your server" indicates that the learner was likely using a server for the project, possibly a virtual machine or cloud instance.

I have received this message do this message suggest that my evaluation is successfully completed coz I forgot to add /api at the end of my vercel url . Or is it like the submission had ran but ultimately produced my score 0. If this is the case I request you to reevaluate my submission.

@Jivraj @carlton

Respected Course Team,

Harsh this side from NIT Allahabad, I am writing to inform you that I received a notification

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image is a screenshot of an email. It shows the email header, sender information, recipient information, subject line, email body, and standard email controls (reply, forward, etc.).

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Subject:** \[TDS Jan 25] Important announcement regarding Project 2
*   **From:** 22t1 se2002 
*   **To:** to me
*   **Date/Time:** 2:26 AM (20 hours ago)
*   **Email Body:**
    *   Dear Learner,
    *   **Please do not ignore this important announcement.** We are still doing some checks on the server endpoints for your TDS Project 2.
    *   If you have turned it off because you were told that evaluations were complete, **please turn them back on.**
    *   We apologise for the inconvenience caused. We aim to complete the evaluations as soon as possible and are cognizant that some of you are using up credits on azure and other platforms to keep them up and running.
    *   We will inform you in subsequent emails when your evaluation is complete so that you do not have to keep them up and running longer than necessary.
    *   Kind regards,
        TDS Team
    *   **Note:** Do NOT reply to this email. It is only meant for official announcements and messages. If you need any further assistance please contact the course team via Discourse.
*   **Unsubscribe** link
*   **Reply** and **Forward** buttons

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The email is an important announcement regarding "Project 2" for a course or program called "TDS" (likely an acronym). The email informs recipients that server endpoint checks are still being conducted. It requests that if recipients have turned off their servers/endpoints (presumably for the project) because they believed evaluations were complete, they should turn them back on. The email apologizes for any inconvenience and mentions that some users are using Azure credits, implying the project involves cloud resources. The email also states that recipients will be notified when evaluations are complete. The email also states that it is for official announcements

regarding an issue with my submission.

I believe the issue may have occurred because I had mistakenly provided an incorrect API endpoint in my earlier submission. However, my server is still actively running on Vercel

[https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app](https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app)

and the correct API endpoint is:

correct api : [https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/](https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/)

Everything else in the project is functioning as expected. I kindly request you to re-evaluate my submission using the correct endpoint as i am currently in my 3rd year of BTech Chemical engineering at NIT Allahabad and my placement session is coming so i don‚Äôt want to get failed in this course due to such a small mistake.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Hello sir, could you please confirm whether I have been evaluated or not?

Roll_No.: 23F3004186

**Image: Screenshot 2025-04-10 100458**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows an email. The email is titled "TDS P2 Endpoint". It's from "23F3004186 VISHNU KUMAR JHA" (with the email address ) to "22f1001123". The sender's profile picture is a cartoon image of a red car.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Subject:** TDS P2 Endpoint
*   **From:** 23F3004186 VISHNU KUMAR JHA 
*   **To:** 22f1001123
*   **Body:**
    *   Dear Saransh,
    *   I hope this message finds you well.
    *   Please find below the complete public endpoint for my P2 API:
    *   `https://vishnu-dns.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`
    *   Please let me know if there are any further issues.
    *   Roll No: 23F3004186
    *   Thank you,
    *   Vishnu Kumar Jha

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The email's purpose is to provide the recipient (Saransh) with the public endpoint for the sender's (Vishnu Kumar Jha) P2 API. The email also includes Vishnu's roll number. It seems to be related to a project or assignment (TDS P2).

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

The email contains a URL: `https://vishnu-dns.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`. This URL points to an API hosted on Microsoft Azure's cloud platform, specifically in the "centralindia" region. The "vishnu-dns" part likely refers to a custom domain or subdomain set up by Vishnu. The "/api" at the end suggests that this is the base endpoint for the API.

Do all of us have to give the latest project link or only those whose links have actually changed. @Saransh_Saini @carlton @Jivraj.

Basically should we resubmit the link using the form sent today if our link has not changed?

PS: Maybe send a mail to everyone to update the access of their GA7 links to viewer for everyone at IIT Madras.

Dear Sirs,

Most of us have hosted our projects in Azure and this is costing us real money .. We have just gotten to a stage where if you could just please let us know if our endpoints have been evaluated and there is some score we will happily take it down.

Kindly bear in mind the there is a financial component ( some of us have free accounts ) involved here and I urge and request you to kindly expedite the evaluation process so that we decrease the financial burden placed upon us by this exercise‚Ä¶

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

I just got the mail stating that my evaluation is complete and I can turn off my server.

However the Cloud Run logs show that all POST requests were made to the wrong end point.

The exact url I gave ends with ‚Äú/api/‚Äù but every POST request was either made to ‚Äú/api‚Äù which resulted in a 307 response or with ‚Äúhttp‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhttps‚Äù which resulted in a 302 response. Only the get requests were made to the correct endpoint but since the app was supposed to allow POST requests only, making GET requests just resulted in 405.

**Image: 1000150868**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image is a screenshot of a web browser displaying the logs of a Cloud Run service on Google Cloud Platform. The UI elements include:

*   **Browser UI:** Address bar, tabs, and standard browser controls.
*   **Google Cloud UI:** Navigation menus, service details (Cloud Run), tabs for different aspects of the service (Metrics, SLOs, Logs, Revisions, etc.), and a log viewer.
*   **Log Viewer:** A table-like structure showing log entries with columns for Severity, Timestamp, and Summary.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Browser Address Bar:** `e.cloud.google.com`
*   **Google Cloud:** "Google Cloud", "WorkshopProj", "Search (/) for resources, docs, products, a...".
*   **Cloud Run Service Details:** "Cloud Run", "Service details", "Set up Continuous Deployment", "tdsproject2shiva", "Region: asia-south1", "URL: https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app".
*   **Log Viewer Tabs:** "Metrics", "SLOs", "Logs", "Revisions", "Triggers", "Networking", "Security", "YAML".
*   **Log Viewer Controls:** "Logs", "Severity", "Default", "Filter", "Search all fields and values".
*   **Log Entries:** The log entries themselves contain a mix of timestamps, severity levels (indicated by icons and text like "INFO", "i", "!"), HTTP status codes (200, 307, 302, 405), request methods (POST, GET), IP addresses, URLs, and messages. Examples:
    *   "2025-04-08 01:17:36.856 IST POST 200 171 B 32 ms python-httpx/0.28.1 https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.r...."
    *   "processing question"
    *   "trying to load"
    *   "

I request you to use the exact url I gave in the gform and make POST requests to it to re-evaluate me. I gave the exact url as asked in the form.

**Image: 1000150872**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image is a screenshot of an email on a mobile device. The email contains two URLs and a question. The email interface includes standard features like reply, reply all, forward buttons, and navigation icons.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Top:** "12:23" (time), standard mobile status bar icons (battery, network, etc.), "81%" (battery percentage).
*   **Email Content:**
    *   "https://github.com/RichPerspective007/tds\_p2"
    *   "What is the link to your API endpoint? *" (The asterisk likely indicates a required field).
    *   "Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL"
    *   "https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/"
    *   "Create your own Google Form"
    *   "Does this form look suspicious? Report"
*   **Email Interface:**
    *   "Reply"
    *   "Reply all"
    *   "Forward"
    *   "No add-ons available for this email"
*   **Bottom Navigation:**
    *   Email icon with "99+" notification
    *   Chat bubble icon with "8" notification

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The email appears to be part of a form or survey, possibly related to a technical project. It asks for the link to an API endpoint and provides a GitHub link. The "Does this form look suspicious?" message suggests a concern about phishing or security.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The first URL is a GitHub link, likely pointing to a repository named "tds\_p2" under the username "RichPerspective007". This suggests the email recipient is involved in a project hosted on GitHub.
*   The second URL is an API endpoint hosted on Google Cloud Run (asia-south1 region). The URL structure suggests it's a dynamically generated endpoint, possibly for a specific project or instance ("tdsproject2shiva-962709320549"). The "/api/" at the end indicates it

Thanks

Regards,

Shivaditya

@Saransh_Saini  @carlton

Hello sir,

I apologize for bothering you again.

About 30 minutes ago, I received an email stating that project 2 has been evaluated. However, when I checked my IP stats, I found there is no special API access. You can verify this. I want to understand whether this is just a wrong email I received or if there is an issue with your system‚Äôs evaluation. Please clarify this doubt, as I am unable to focus on my final term exam.

i closed my local machine too I spent one month on this project please consider my problem

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a command-line interface (CLI) output, likely from a Python script. The output displays information about unique IP addresses that have accessed a specific API endpoint.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Command Prompt:** `PS E:\data science tool\main\grok> python uniu.py`
*   **Output:**
    *   `Found 5 unique IP addresses:`
    *   A list of IP addresses, each followed by:
        *   `Accessed endpoints: /api/`
        *   `API endpoint access count: [number]` (The numbers vary: 93, 48, 39, 43, 39)
    *   `Total /api/ endpoint calls: 262`
    *   `IPs accessing /api/ endpoint: 5`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The script `uniu.py` (likely written in Python) is analyzing data (presumably log files or network traffic) to identify unique IP addresses that have accessed the `/api/` endpoint. It then counts how many times each IP address has accessed that endpoint. Finally, it provides a total count of all `/api/` endpoint calls and the number of unique IPs that accessed it. This is a common task in web server log analysis, security monitoring, or API usage tracking.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **Programming Language:** Python (indicated by `python uniu.py`)
*   **Script Name:** `uniu.py` (likely short for "unique")
*   **Data Analysis:** The script is performing basic data aggregation and counting.
*   **API Endpoint:** The script is specifically tracking access to the `/api/` endpoint.
*   **Output Format:** The output is formatted for readability, with clear labels for IP addresses, accessed endpoints, and access counts.
*   **Data Source:** The script is likely reading data from a file or stream, but the source is not explicitly shown in the image.

I checked my Vercel logs and saw that the requests were sent to the /api endpoint instead of the /api/ endpoint that I specifically gave in the google forms.

To confirm this I also sent a request to /api and /api/ enpoints and the /api gave a 404 error while /api/ gave a 200 message.

Please look into this

Yes I also got the same email, but when I checked my vercel dashboard I found no such api access. Kindly verify this @Saransh_Saini @carlton

Today I got my TDS Project-2 Score and it is showing as absent although I submitted my TDS project 2 , also deployed the app successfully and also filled the g-form

Here‚Äôs my deployed application on-render link with the attached screenshot of my TDS Dashboard:

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a student's grade report or progress page within an online course platform. It displays the student's scores for various assignments, quizzes, and projects. There's also an indication of whether the student is allowed to take the end-term exam.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Title:** "Tools in Data Science"
*   **Subtitle:** "NEW COURSE"
*   **Assignment Scores:**
    *   "Week 1 Assignment - 92.50"
    *   "Week 2 Assignment - 90.00"
    *   "Week 3 Assignment - 0.00"
    *   "Week 4 Assignment - 100.00"
    *   "Week 5 Assignment - 100.00"
    *   "Week 6 Assignment - Absent"
*   **Quiz Score:** "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - 90.00"
*   **Project Scores:**
    *   "COURSE PROJECT - 5.00"
    *   "Course Project Score 2 - Absent"
*   **Exam Eligibility:** "Allowed to take End Term Exam? Yes"
*   **Button Text:** "Go to Course page >"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The purpose of the display is to provide a student with a clear overview of their performance in the "Tools in Data Science" course. It shows their scores on individual assignments, quizzes, and projects, and informs them whether they are eligible to take the final exam. The "Go to Course page" button likely links back to the main course page for further navigation.

**4. Technical details:**

The image is a UI element, likely rendered in a web browser. The layout is simple and straightforward, using text labels and numerical scores to present the information. The use of "Absent" suggests that some assignments or projects may not have been submitted or graded yet. The fact that the student is allowed to take the end-term exam despite some missing or low scores implies that there's a minimum threshold or weighting system in place.

Dear Sir,

In my course dashboard, it shows project 2 status as absent, but i have already submitted the repo and api points well before deadline in the given forum. Still my vercel server is running and api is resolving as expected. Please look into this matter, because I already had issue in my project 1 and lost marks in that. Expecting a positive response from your end.

Hello Sir, my project 2 score is showing as 0. I had got email saying please update endpoint because earlier endpoint was having problems. I had sent [https://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app/api/](https://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app/api/) as updated endpoint in google form on April 10th. Same day I had got around 9 requests on that endpoint around 4:56 PM. They were 200 OK requests on /api/ and 4 requests  were 307 redirect on /api. I presume they were from TDS team. Next day got email to shut off endpoint. I had tested endpoint locally and on ngrok. Both were fine. Was the updated endpoint in the google form evaluated? Was there some problem with the updated endpoint?

Namaste Sir. The projects have been quite challenging, and I have applied my knowledge to the best of my ability. I‚Äôve submitted the project but it‚Äôs showing 0 in the portal. Bonus marks for creating APIs and so in the projects would be greatly appreciated. I am planning to start my degree in the upcoming term, and this is the last subject I am completing at this level. So, I kindly request your assistance, sir.

@carlton @Saransh_Saini sir ,

I am writing to kindly request a re-evaluation of my Project 2 submission. As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately **50 to 60 seconds** to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both **Podman** and **Linux** environments.

Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on **Railway** and submitted that link as well.

If possible, I kindly request either of the following:

Re-evaluation using the **Railway link** I provided, or
Re-evaluation using the **Render link**, with allowance for the 50‚Äì60 second activation time.

Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed.

Thank you for your support and guidance.

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I knew that this affected my project 2 score and that‚Äôs why I made that post(the one to which I‚Äôm replying in this message). Please look into this. My api is working and still on and will be on till 18th April when my credits will run out. Please re-evaluate my project 2 with the exact url I gave in the form. My project 2 was evaluated on the wrong url and this led to a zero in the project 2 score.

Hi sir  @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @s.anand

I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

 :white_check_mark:  **Server is running and reachable. and Giving Correct Answers**

 :white_check_mark:  **GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code**, both return **200 OK**.

 :white_check_mark:  **Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people** ‚Äì all received correct results.

 :white_check_mark:  **No issues seen in logs or deployment** ‚Äì everything was set up properly.

 :white_check_mark:  **Others in my group got full marks** ‚Äì we worked on the same project.

 :red_exclamation_mark:  **I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.**

 :red_exclamation_mark:  **I‚Äôve spent weeks working on this project**, including sleepless nights.

 :red_exclamation_mark:  **This is my last term** ‚Äì if I fail, I will have to repeat the entire diploma.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:

**API Documentation:** [FastAPI - Swagger UI](http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs)
**API Endpoint:** [http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api](http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api)

I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.

I‚Äôve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.

MY Project 2  status is currently marked as Absent in the course dashboard. However, I would like to clarify that I submitted the repository and API endpoints well before the deadline through the designated forum.

Additionally, my Vercel server is still active, and the API is functioning correctly, as can be verified here:

 :link:  [API Form Submission](https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/)

I kindly request you to review my submission

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web page with a form. The form is contained within a white box centered on the page. The form allows a user to submit a question and optionally upload a ZIP file.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Page Title:** "Submit Your Question"
*   **Form Label:** "Question:"
*   **Form Label:** "Upload ZIP File (optional):"
*   **Button Label:** "Choose File"
*   **Text:** "No file chosen"
*   **Button Label:** "Submit"
*   **URL:** "tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The purpose of the page is to allow users to submit questions, potentially with supporting files in ZIP format. This could be part of a help desk, a question-answering system, or a feedback form. The URL suggests that this is an API endpoint.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The URL "tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/" indicates that the application is likely hosted on Vercel, a platform for deploying web applications. The "/api/" part suggests that this is an API endpoint, meaning it's designed to receive data and process it on the server-side.
*   The form includes a file upload field, which allows users to upload a ZIP file. The "(optional)" text indicates that uploading a file is not required.
*   The "Submit" button triggers the submission of the form data to the server.

Project 2 marks are showing 0 for me, when I checked logs no requests were made to my endpoint. Could you please check into this, and update as soon as possible?

Getting marks in this project would help me to pass this sub. Also, please check if evaluation has been done for my endpoint or not.

Thank you

Sir, I too had provided render API and my logs do not show that it was accessed during the evaluation period. I had submitted the link in the form which was provided to update the link as i had not received any mail that my project had been evaluated before that.

Due to this, my score stands 0 as of now.

Sir, can you please look into this. Thank you

MY Project 2 status is currently marked as Absent in the course dashboard. However, I would like to clarify that I submitted the repository and API endpoints well before the deadline through the designated forum.

Additionally, my Vercel server is still active, and the API is functioning correctly, as can be verified here:

I kindly request you to review my submission

Request for Re-evaluation

I have completed the entire project and ensured that my model is working correctly. Despite this, I have received **zero marks**, which seems to be an error.

Dear Sir,

In my course dashboard, Project 2 score is shown as zero. However, I had submitted the repository and API endpoints ([http://35.192.157.22.80](http://35.192.157.22.80)) through the Google Form. I had received a mail to make edit in API end point if changed. I had edited my api end point by adding  /api/ and it was [http://35.192.157.22/api/](http://35.192.157.22/api/). My server was running fine. I have worked hard to do this project and now receiving a score of zero. Kindly look into it.

Sir I have also recieved 0 marks, but I checked now also using python requests library and my server is working fine .  But I see a lot of GET requets instead of POST in my logs file which was for the past couple of days requests, which is very unlikely . Please check my link again , its still active . App link  -  [http://16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2](http://16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2)

My test file-

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of a code editor (likely VS Code) and a terminal window. The code editor displays a Python script named "burima.py". The terminal window shows the output of running this script.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Python Code (burima.py):**
    *   `import requests`
    *   `# Replace with your actual FastAPI server URL`
    *   `url = "http://16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2"`
    *   `# Define form data`
    *   `data = { "question": r"""What is the total sales of all the items in the "Gold" ticket type? Write SQL to ca`
    *   `files={"file": ("q-fastapi.csv", open("C:/Users/suneh/Downloads/q-fastapi.csv", "rb"), "text/plain")}`
    *   `# Send the POST request`
    *   `response = requests.post(url, data=data) #files=files`
*   **Terminal Output:**
    *   `PS C:\Users\suneh\lab5> python burima.py`
    *   `Status Code: 200`
    *   `Response JSON: {"answer": "SELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales FROM tickets WHERE LOWER (TRIM(type)) = 'gold';"}`
    *   `PS C:\Users\suneh\lab5>`

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The Python script is designed to send a POST request to a FastAPI server. The request includes:

*   A question in the `data` dictionary, asking for the total sales of "Gold" ticket types, and requesting an SQL query to calculate it.
*   A file named "q-fastapi.csv" which is sent as part of the request.

The script then prints the response from the server. The terminal output shows that the server responded with a status code of 200 (OK) and a JSON response containing an SQL query. The SQL query calculates the sum of (units \* price) for all

My server log file -

**Image: Screenshot 2025-04-14 144745**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays text output resembling a server log or network traffic analysis. The text is presented in a monospaced font, typical of terminal or console output. The background is black, and the text is white.

**2. Text Content:**

The text consists of lines that start with either "INFO:" or "WARNING:". Following the "INFO:" tag, there's an IP address and port number, followed by an HTTP request and its corresponding status code. The "WARNING:" lines indicate "Invalid HTTP request received."

Here's a breakdown of the types of lines:

*   **INFO: IP:Port "HTTP Request" Status Code**
    *   Example: `INFO: 103.158.43.17:17624 - "POST /tdsp2 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
    *   This line indicates an HTTP request from a specific IP address and port. It shows the HTTP method (e.g., POST, GET), the requested resource (e.g., /tdsp2, /), the HTTP version, and the server's response status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
*   **WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.**
    *   This line suggests that the server received a request that it couldn't process, likely due to malformed syntax or other issues.

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image likely shows a snippet of a server log or network monitoring output. The purpose is to track incoming HTTP requests, identify their source, and record the server's response. The "WARNING" messages indicate potential problems with client requests, which could be due to errors, malicious activity, or misconfigured clients.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **IP Addresses and Ports:** The IP addresses and port numbers (e.g., `103.158.43.17:17624`) identify the client making the request.
*   **HTTP Methods:** The HTTP methods (e.g., `POST`, `GET`) indicate the type of action the client is requesting.
*   **HTTP Versions:** The HTTP versions (e.g., `HTTP/

My app request handeling -

**Image: Screenshot 2025-04-14 224629**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a snippet of Python code, likely from a web application framework like FastAPI or similar. It defines an asynchronous function decorated with a route handler.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The code contains the following text:

*   `@app.post("/tdsp2")`
*   `async def tdsp2(question: str = Form(...), file: Optional[UploadFile] = File(None)):`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

This code defines an API endpoint that handles POST requests to the `/tdsp2` route. The function `tdsp2` is designed to receive two parameters:

*   `question`: A string parameter obtained from a form. The `Form(...)` part suggests that this parameter is required.
*   `file`: An optional file upload. The `Optional[UploadFile]` type hint indicates that the file parameter is optional, and if provided, it should be an `UploadFile` object. The `File(None)` part sets the default value to `None` if no file is uploaded.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **`@app.post("/tdsp2")`**: This is a decorator that associates the `tdsp2` function with the `/tdsp2` route for POST requests. It's a common pattern in web frameworks to define API endpoints.
*   **`async def`**: This indicates that the function is asynchronous, allowing it to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking.
*   **`question: str = Form(...)`**: This defines a parameter named `question` of type string (`str`). The `Form(...)` part suggests that this parameter is expected to be received as part of a form submission in the POST request. The `...` likely indicates that the parameter is required.
*   **`file: Optional[UploadFile] = File(None)`**: This defines a parameter named `file` that is an optional file upload. `Optional[UploadFile]` means that the parameter can either be an `UploadFile` object or `None`. `File(None)` sets the default value to `None` if no file is provided in the request. The `UploadFile` type likely comes from a library like FastAPI, which provides

I noticed that my  Project 2  status is currently marked as  ‚ÄúAbsent‚Äù in the course dashboard. However, I would like to clarify that I **submitted the GitHub repository and Vercel API link well before the deadline

via the designated forum.

Additionally, my **Vercel server is still active**, and the API is functioning correctly, which can be verified here:

 :link:  [API Form Submission](https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/)

I also have a **response copy from the forum confirming my submission**, including both the GitHub and Vercel links, as proof. I kindly request you to review this and take the necessary steps to update my project status.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a portion of a Google Form. The form contains two questions related to providing links to a GitHub repository and an API endpoint. The form is displayed within a web browser interface, as indicated by the standard Google Forms header icons (undo, redo, customize theme, preview, settings, send, more options). There are also navigation arrows and a page number indicator.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Form Title (Implied):** While the full title isn't visible, the questions suggest it's related to a "Project 2".
*   **Question 1:** "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2? *" (The asterisk indicates it's a required question).
    *   **Hint:** "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name"
    *   **Answer:** "https://github.com/itskaiffazal/tdsproject2"
*   **Question 2:** "What is the link to your API endpoint? *" (Required question)
    *   **Instruction:** "Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL"
    *   **Answer:** "https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/"
*   **Footer:**
    *   "Create your own Google Form" (link)
    *   "Does this form look suspicious? Report" (link)
*   **Page Navigation:** "5 of 118" with left and right arrow buttons.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The form is likely being used to collect information from individuals who have completed a project (Project 2). The form creator is specifically requesting the link to the GitHub repository containing the project's code and the link to the project's API endpoint. The instruction to ensure a POST request can be sent to the API endpoint suggests the API is designed to receive data.

**4. Technical details (based on the content):**

*   **GitHub Repository:** The provided GitHub link "https://github.com/itskaiffazal/tdsproject2" suggests that the user "itskaiffazal" has a repository named "tdspro

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser window displaying a simple form. The form is contained within a white box centered on the page. The form includes fields for submitting a question and uploading a ZIP file.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Browser Address Bar:** `tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/`
*   **Form Title:** "Submit Your Question"
*   **Form Labels:**
    *   "Question:"
    *   "Upload ZIP File (optional):"
    *   "Choose File"
    *   "No file chosen"
*   **Button Label:** "Submit"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The form appears to be designed for users to submit questions, potentially along with supporting files in a ZIP archive. The "optional" label next to the ZIP file upload suggests that submitting a file is not required. The URL `tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/` indicates that this form likely interacts with a backend API endpoint.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The form is likely implemented using HTML.
*   The "Choose File" button is a standard HTML file input element.
*   The form is hosted on Vercel, a platform for deploying web applications.
*   The API endpoint is located at `/api/`.

Dear Sir, @carlton @Jivraj

I need your immediate attention regarding my **project-2 , as I received zero marks,** but **my server is running completely fine**. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

Server is running and reachable. and Giving The Correct Answers

GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code, both return 200 OK.

Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people ‚Äì all received correct results.

No issues seen in logs or deployment ‚Äì everything was set up properly.

Others in my group got full marks ‚Äì we worked on the same project.

I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.

I‚Äôve spent weeks working on this project, including sleepless nights.

Cant have least scores despite all the efforts.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:

API Documentation: [FastAPI - Swagger UI](https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs)

I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.

I‚Äôve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.

Please don‚Äôt ignore this.

Thanks,

My marks are also showing as zero.

My suggestion is to provide students with the logs of your evaluation script, so we know if it is that server was not reachable, the answer is incorrect, or the response format was incorrect..etc

Request you to let us know if there is going to be re-evaluation so we can get the Azure instance running again

*   **Requests:** A list of POST requests to the `/api` endpoint, including timestamps (in IST), and HTTP status codes (307 Temporary Redirect, 200 OK).

The keyboard shows standard alphanumeric keys, function keys (F3-F7), and symbols.

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The terminal output suggests the user is running a local server and using Ngrok to expose it to the internet. The request logs show API calls being made, with some resulting in temporary redirects (307) and others in successful responses (200 OK). This is likely a development or debugging environment.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **Ngrok:** The presence of the Ngrok URL indicates that the user is using Ngrok to create a secure tunnel from their local machine to a public URL. This is commonly used for testing webhooks, APIs, or web applications that need to be accessible from the internet during development.
*   **HTTP Status Codes:** The 307 status code indicates a temporary redirect, meaning the client should re-request the resource at a different URL. The 200 OK status code indicates that the request was successful.
*   **API Endpoint:** The requests

Hi Sir,

Even I got zero in project 2. My server was running fine and both get and post requests were going through. I stopped the server after I got a confirmation mail that the evaluation were completed. Please check.

Dear TAs please help - even I got 0 in project 2 even though I have submitted the right links with all prerequisites & working server. If you can share some evaluation logs or errors that would be very helpful to know where I went wrong possibly.

I  received 20 in project 2 which I think is not correct. I also tested my api with questions with different parameters to make sure it is giving correct responses. You are requested to kindly recheck and share the evaluation logs.

Hi sir  @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @s.anand

I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

 :white_check_mark:  **Server is running and reachable.**

 :white_check_mark:  **GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code**, both return **200 OK**.

 :white_check_mark:  **Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people** ‚Äì all received correct results.

 :white_check_mark:  **No issues seen in logs or deployment** ‚Äì everything was set up properly.

 :white_check_mark:  **Others in my group got full marks** ‚Äì we worked on the same project.

 :red_exclamation_mark:  **I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.**

 :red_exclamation_mark:  **I‚Äôve spent weeks working on this project**, including sleepless nights.

 :red_exclamation_mark:  **This is my last term** ‚Äì if I fail, I will have to repeat the entire diploma.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:

**API Documentation:** [FastAPI - Swagger UI](http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs)
**API Endpoint:** [http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api](http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api)

I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.

I‚Äôve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.

Hi @carlton

@Saransh_Saini @Jivraj

Sir the same issue occurred on my end as well. My endpoint is returning the correct output, as demonstrated by @SK76 . However, it has still been marked as 0.

Could you please check whether the evaluation is still in progress or has been finalized? I would appreciate any update on the status.

(54/57 questions working, tested with different values and parameters)

Roll num :  21f3001076

Thank you.

We are sending an email out for all those that have raised an issue within the next few hours. The content of the email will be to keep your server up in the window that we prescribe. That window will be mentioned in the email. You do not need to keep the vm running at the moment. Just check the email when it comes.

Please check it out. My app can remain deployed only till April 18th. In the Cloud Run logs, I do see some multiple POST requests made today with 200 response but I‚Äôm not sure whether it was the TDS team doing a re-evaluation or someone else.

Also, are there any updates on [this bug in project 1 in datagen.](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/451)

@carlton  @Jivraj  @Saransh_Saini I also received 20 in project 2 which I think is not correct. I also tested my api with questions with different parameters to make sure it is giving correct responses with questions with variable parameters. You are requested to kindly recheck and share the evaluation logs.

Sir, Same here, you can access it via this link [Assignment solver ](https://phoenix-1743854088883.staticrun.app/)

I kindly request you to check immediately by this link as I also have made it as an web app for your ease.

(my friends: please don‚Äôt use the link, as the api token request will be over)

Please look after it, already I was marked as absent for project -1 and now for this project -2 as 0. I don‚Äôt know why?..I don‚Äôt know whether I could be able to pass this course even with lots of efforts..

I am also seeing a score of 0. This is after the course TA‚Äôs said that I had scored well on the project without revealing my score. But I am pretty sure they won‚Äôt classify 0/100 as a good score.

Sir,

I have submitted the working url but forgot to add /api in the end. Please consider my request and evaluate this below link. This below link is same as the submitted link just with /api.

**Image: IMG-20250409-WA0007**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of a Google Form displayed on a mobile device. The form consists of several questions. The UI elements include text fields for answering the questions, along with instructions and example formats. The form is displayed in dark mode.

**2. Text Content:**

The text content includes:

*   "work email ID. You can submit only one response. You can correct your response after you submit. Your email (24f2006749@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was recorded when you submitted this form."
*   "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2? *"
    *   "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name"
    *   "https://github.com/Sakshi6749/PROJECT-2"
*   "What is the link to your API endpoint? *"
    *   "Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL"
    *   "saakshi-llama.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com"
*   "Create your own Google Form"
*   "Does this form look suspicious? Report"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The form appears to be part of a project submission or evaluation process, likely for a course or assignment. It's collecting information about the student's GitHub repository and API endpoint. The email address is automatically recorded.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The form is asking for a GitHub repository link, suggesting the student has code hosted on GitHub. The example URL provided is `https://github.com/user-name/repository-name`. The student has provided `https://github.com/Sakshi6749/PROJECT-2`.
*   The form is also asking for an API endpoint URL, indicating the student has deployed an API. The student has provided `saakshi-llama.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com`, which suggests the API is hosted on Azure's cloudapp service. The form explicitly mentions that a POST request will be sent to this endpoint.
*   The email address `24f2006749@ds.study.

2 days back I got my TDS Project-2 Score and it is showing as absent although I submitted my TDS project 2 , also deployed the app successfully and also filled the g-form

Here‚Äôs my deployed application on-render link with the attached screenshot of my TDS Dashboard:

Project : [https://tds-project2-21f3000591.onrender.com/](https://tds-project2-21f3000591.onrender.com/)

**Image: Screenshot 2025-04-16 125037**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a course progress page, likely from an online learning platform. It displays the student's scores for various assignments, quizzes, and projects within a course.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Course Title:** "Tools in Data Science"
*   **Course Status:** "NEW COURSE"
*   **Assignment Scores:**
    *   Week 1 Assignment - 92.50
    *   Week 2 Assignment - 90.00
    *   Week 3 Assignment - 0.00
    *   Week 4 Assignment - 100.00
    *   Week 5 Assignment - 100.00
    *   Week 6 Assignment - Absent
    *   Week 7 Assignment - Absent
*   **Average Assignment Score:** "Average Assignment for final Scoring - 96.00"
*   **Programming Quiz Score:** "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - 90.00"
*   **Course Project Scores:**
    *   COURSE PROJECT - 5.00
    *   Course Project Score 2 - Absent
*   **End Term Exam Eligibility:** "Allowed to take End Term Exam? Yes"
*   **Call to Action:** "Go to Course page >"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The purpose of this page is to provide a student with an overview of their performance in the "Tools in Data Science" course. It shows individual assignment scores, an average assignment score, quiz scores, project scores, and whether the student is eligible to take the end-term exam. The "Go to Course page" button likely redirects the student back to the main course page.

**4. Technical Details:**

The image is a UI element, likely rendered in HTML/CSS. The layout is structured with clear labels and values for each assessment. The use of "Absent" indicates that the student did not submit or participate in those assignments. The average assignment score is calculated and displayed. The page dynamically determines and displays whether the student is allowed to take the end-term exam based on their performance.

I got a mail saying project 2 endpoints will be tested again.

It also says that those updated endpoints which were submitted in the google form will be tested. Since i had submitted ngrok endpoint, wont it be invalid now?

And if i start ngrok server wont it give me new endpoint?

You were not present in the form Anand gave us. It most likely because you submitted after the deadline (or made edits after the deadline, if the form he shared allowed edits).

I‚Äôm writing to clarify the status of my  Project 2, which is currently marked as ‚ÄúAbsent‚Äù. I would like to respectfully state that I **submitted the form before the deadline** ‚Äî specifically on  31st March 2025 at 22:11 , and I have the  response copy as proof.

I would also like to emphasize that:

No edits were made to the form after submission.

I  did not make any changes to the project or submission after the deadline.

My  Vercel API is still active  and functioning as expected.

Here are the submitted links:

 :link:  GitHub Repo: [GitHub - itskaiffazal/tdsproject2: Tools in data science Project 2 - TDS Solver](https://github.com/itskaiffazal/tdsproject2)

 :link:  API Endpoint: [https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/](https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/)

I kindly request you to review my submission  and take the necessary steps to update the status.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of an email received in Gmail. The email is a confirmation receipt from Google Forms.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Gmail logo**
*   **Email Subject:** "TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025"
*   **Sender:** "Google Forms "
*   **Recipient:** "To: kaiffazal001@gmail.com"
*   **Sender Name:** "Kaif Fazal "
*   **Date and Time:** "31 March 2025 at 22:11"
*   **Google Forms logo**
*   **Confirmation Message:** "Thanks for filling in TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025"
*   "Here's what was received."
*   **Button Label:** "Edit response"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The email serves as a confirmation that the recipient, kaiffazal001@gmail.com, has successfully submitted a Google Form titled "TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025". The email provides a link (via the "Edit response" button) to allow the recipient to review and potentially modify their submission.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The email is formatted as an HTML email, likely generated automatically by Google Forms.
*   The "forms-receipts-noreply@google.com" address indicates that the email is an automated notification and replies are not monitored.
*   The "Edit response" button likely contains a URL that includes a unique identifier for the specific form submission, allowing the recipient to access their data.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a portion of an email interface, specifically displaying a Google Form embedded within the email. The form consists of two questions, each asking for a URL. The email interface includes standard elements like reply and forward buttons, and navigation to other emails.

**2. Text Content:**

*   "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2? \*"
*   "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name"
*   "https://github.com/itskaiffazal/tdsproject2" (This appears to be the answer provided for the first question)
*   "What is the link to your API endpoint? \*"
*   "Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL"
*   "https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/" (This appears to be the answer provided for the second question)
*   "Create your own Google Form"
*   "Does this form look suspicious? Report"
*   "Reply"
*   "Forward"
*   "7 of 134" (Indicates the email is part of a sequence)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows someone filling out a Google Form, likely as part of a project submission or evaluation. The form is requesting the GitHub repository link and the API endpoint link for a project called "Project 2". The asterisk (\*) indicates that both questions are required. The "Create your own Google Form" and "Does this form look suspicious? Report" links at the bottom suggest this is a standard Google Form.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The GitHub link follows the standard format: `https://github.com/[username]/[repository-name]`. The provided link suggests the username is "itskaiffazal" and the repository name is "tdsproject2".
*   The API endpoint link uses the Vercel platform (`vercel.app`). The endpoint is located at `/api/`. The URL suggests the project name is "tdsproject2".
*   The instruction to "Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL" indicates that the API endpoint is expected to handle POST requests.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser window displaying a simple form. The form is contained within a white box centered on the page. The form has fields for submitting a question and uploading a ZIP file.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Browser Address Bar:** `tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/`
*   **Form Title:** "Submit Your Question"
*   **Question Label:** "Question:"
*   **Upload Label:** "Upload ZIP File (optional):"
*   **File Upload Button:** "Choose File"
*   **File Status:** "No file chosen"
*   **Submit Button:** "Submit"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The form appears to be designed for users to submit questions, potentially with an associated ZIP file for additional context or supporting materials. The "optional" label on the ZIP file upload suggests that it's not required for every submission. The URL in the address bar indicates that this form is part of an API endpoint hosted on Vercel.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The URL `tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/` suggests this is a serverless function or API route deployed on Vercel.
*   The form includes a text area for the question and a file upload field.
*   The "Submit" button likely triggers a POST request to the API endpoint, sending the question and the file (if selected) to the server.

You used your personal email address while filling the form. It is impossible for us to track who is submitting a form if you do not use your official email id. Unfortunately we cannot evaluate your submission.

sir i am sorry that i keep resending this same message but please clarify this alone sir.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows an email interface, specifically the content of an email message. The email is displayed within a typical email client layout.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The email's subject is "22t1 se2002". The email is addressed "to me". The body of the email contains the following text:

*   "Dear Learner,"
*   "We have decided to re-run P2 Evaluations on your endpoint server because of your low score."
*   "We kindly request you to turn on your server endpoint from 11:00 pm to 02:00 am TONIGHT. After that you may turn off your server. You do not need to turn it on before 11:00 pm. We will start evaluations at 11:00pm and it will end at 2:00 am."
*   "We will be testing the endpoint that you have submitted in the official forms only."
*   "Please note that we will NOT test endpoints that you submitted in discourse or via email."
*   "If you sent an updated endpoint in the latest form which we had sent, we will test that endpoint, otherwise we will use your previous endpoint. The endpoint we are testing is shown below (no other endpoint will be tested):"
*   "https://e95b-2405-201-e04b-d085-9cf5-4f92-fe5a-309e.ngrok-free.app/ask"

The email also has a timestamp of "5:01 PM (1 hour ago)".

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The email is a notification to a learner (likely a student) regarding a re-run of evaluations on their endpoint server. The re-run is due to a low score. The email specifies the time window during which the server endpoint needs to be active for the evaluation. It also clarifies which endpoints will be tested (those submitted in official forms) and provides the specific endpoint that will be tested.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

The email mentions "endpoint server" and "endpoint". The

the mail i got mentions that no other endpoint will be tested and it is showing the old ngrok link. now if i edit the form and change the url will you consider the new one? please clarify sir‚Ä¶

**Image: Sir this is my repository and link for my api please look into it**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of a mobile phone screen, likely an email or messaging app. The main content is a Google Form with two questions related to a coding project. The UI elements include:

*   Top bar with time (18:59), battery percentage (98%), and network indicators.
*   Navigation icons (back arrow, download, trash, email, and three dots).
*   Two question blocks from a Google Form.
*   Bottom bar with attachment, reply, send, and emoji icons.
*   A notification icon indicating 99+ unread emails.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Question 1:** "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2? *" (The asterisk indicates a required field).
    *   Instruction: "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name"
    *   Answer: "https://github.com/kartikayy1/project2final"
*   **Question 2:** "What is the link to your API endpoint? *"

*   "Create your own Google Form"
*   "Does this form look suspicious? Report"
*   "Reply"

The form is requesting the link to the GitHub repository containing the code for "Project 2" and the link to the API endpoint for the project. The instructions emphasize the correct format for the GitHub link and the importance of providing the exact API endpoint URL for POST requests.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The GitHub link provided suggests a repository named "project2final" owned by the user "kartikayy1".
*   The API endpoint URL indicates that the API is hosted on Vercel, a platform for deploying web applications. The subdomain "project2final-beta" suggests this is a beta version of the API.

I sincerely apologize for not using my official email address ‚Äî it was an honest oversight and not an attempt to bypass any rules. I‚Äôd be truly grateful if you could kindly consider evaluating my project based on the  valid, timely submission and the active working links provided.

This situation is quite distressing for me, as it could result in a significant  setback, potentially requiring me to  repeat the entire course. I fully acknowledge that the mistake was mine ‚Äî a small yet critical one ‚Äî and I sincerely request that if there is even a slight possibility of evaluation, please consider it.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist with verification. Your understanding and support would genuinely mean a lot.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respected Carlton Sir,

      [tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app](https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/)

[TDS Solver](https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/)

but for the API testing we need to add /api/ to the url:

[https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/](https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/)

Please do my evaluation on this link, its the same just we need to go to /api/ in the URL

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

Dear Sirs,

I apologize for the inconvenience caused by reaching out again. I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end.

I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as ‚ÄúAbsent,‚Äù despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks.

For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment.

I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in.

I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding.

Respected Sir,

Sir I made a mistake while submitting the GFORM in hurry, I submitted the deployment URL instead of API URL:

currently for re-evaluation my URL that I received on my mail id is:

`https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/`

but for API testing we need to add /api/ to the URL so final URL is:

`https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/`

I‚Äôm sorry for this mistake sir, please accept this small change, we just need to add /api/ to the URL

Thank you

actually 2 of my friend had submitted similar url with no /api/ but he got 80 marks and I also submitted without /api/ url but I got 0 so for re evaluation sir please add /api/ to the original URL as mentioned Above Please Sir

Thank you

I would like to clarify that I had submitted the form before the deadline. However, I believe I might have submitted it once again after the deadline, just to ensure that my project was submitted correctly.

Please find attached the screenshot of my submission made before the deadline. Also, I haven‚Äôt received any response sheet for the form submitted after the deadline.

hello sir,

the link have submitted has a UI interface for solving the question which looks somewhat like this

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) for a tool called "TDS GA Solver". It appears to be a web form or application designed to answer questions related to GA (likely Google Analytics, given the context). The UI elements include:

*   A text input area for asking a question.
*   A file upload section (optional).
*   A "Submit" button.
*   A response area to display the answer.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Title:** "TDS GA Solver"
*   **Label:** "Ask a GA Question:"
*   **Placeholder:** "Type your question here..."
*   **Label:** "Upload File (Optional):"
*   **Button:** "Choose File"
*   **Text:** "No file chosen"
*   **Button:** "Submit"
*   **Label:** "Response:"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The purpose of the UI is to allow users to ask questions related to Google Analytics (GA) and receive answers. Users can optionally upload a file, presumably to provide additional context or data for the question. The "TDS" part of the title might refer to the organization or system providing this tool.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The UI is designed with a clean and modern aesthetic, using a gradient background and rounded corners.
*   The file upload section indicates that the user can select a file from their local system.
*   The "Submit" button suggests that the question and optional file will be sent to a server for processing.
*   The "Response" area implies that the answer will be displayed dynamically after the question is processed.

in order to access the endpoint we just need to add ‚Äú/api‚Äù on the end however in the form I have submitted the link without the end line.

Please Consider,

Thanks & Regards,

So anyone with an ngrok endpoint can send their new ngrok to us, but obviously you will need to start the server up much sooner than 11 in that case. An email will be sent to you specifically. DO NOT give us the endpoint on discourse. Reply to the email we will send specifically for you.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The email is a notification from Microsoft Azure informing the recipient that their free credit has expired and their subscription has been disabled. The purpose of the email is to encourage the recipient to upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription to continue using Azure services. It highlights the benefits of upgrading, such as free access to certain products. It also warns the user about the impending deletion of their subscription data if they don't take action.

Since we will be evaluating between 11 to am you can run application on local machine and provide us with the ngrok url by 10:30 pm.

Send us the correct endpoint test it before sending us.

After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using **public DNS services** like **Google (8.8.8.8)** or **Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)**. This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio).

 :hammer_and_wrench:  Suggested Fix:

To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a **public DNS** provider?

Recommended options:

**Google DNS**: `8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`
**Cloudflare DNS**: `1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`

This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment‚Äôs networking configuration.

 :repeat_button:  Alternate Option:

If the DNS change isn‚Äôt possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the **previously deployed endpoint** instead:

https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/

Please note that this endpoint may take **50 to 60 seconds** to respond, as it‚Äôs hosted on a platform with a cold start delay ‚Äî but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs.

Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results.

Thank you so much for your time and support ‚Äî I truly appreciate the effort you‚Äôre putting into helping us succeed in this course!

Best regards,

**Sahil Raj**

Sir, my endpoint is deployed on render too. Hence it may take upto two minutes for the server to respond.

Thankyou!

Thanks. These re evals are running on the gcloud vm so it should not be an issue, but we will check anyway. Its a good tip.

Dear @Jivraj @carlton

In the google form which we submitted I had pasted the API endpoint as the one which I got in the vercel dashboard i.e. [https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/](https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/)

whereas the correct api for giving post requests has **/api** added to the above which i forgot to add. i.e**.[https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/**](https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/**)

I have checked again and the post requests are working.

I know that I made a mistake in the form and regret the same. If possible, please evaluate my project 2 with  the above endpoint

Greetings, @carlton  @Jivraj  @Saransh_Saini

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to kindly request the addition of an API to the link I previously submitted for Project 2. I realized that including this API is essential for the complete functionality and demonstration of the project.

please use this api url -: [https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/api/](https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/api/)

instead of this -  [https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/](https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/)

Thank you for your time and support. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Jivraj,

I would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.

At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it‚Äôs not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.

I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently.

Additionally, I believe the image may show your server‚Äôs IP address.

Thank you!

**Image: 1000063856**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of a Windows PowerShell terminal. The terminal displays output from a program, likely a data science tool, that is processing files and logging information.

**2. Text Content:**

The terminal output includes the following key text elements:

*   `ng question with file: E://data science tool//GA1//eighteenth.py` (and similar lines for other files)
*   `lution for: E://data science tool//GA1//eighteenth.py` (and similar lines for other files)
*   `103.158.43.22:0 - "POST /api/ HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
*   `tds_app - INFO - Logged IP 103.158.43.22 accessing /api/`
*   `GitHub Pages query ‚Üí GA2/third.py`
*   `E://data science tool//GA3//second.py (score: 0.41, confidence: 40%)` (and similar lines for other files)
*   `in: openai`, `in: github`, `in: excel`

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The output suggests the following:

*   The program is processing files located in a directory structure like `E://data science tool//GA1//`, `E://data science tool//GA2//`, etc.
*   For each file, it seems to be "asking a question" and providing a "solution."
*   The program is logging API access, specifically `POST` requests to `/api/`, and indicating a `200 OK` status (successful HTTP response).
*   The program is logging the IP address `103.158.43.22` accessing the `/api/` endpoint.
*   The program is performing queries related to GitHub Pages.
*   The program is assigning a "score" and "confidence" to the files it processes.
*   The program is using different tools like openai, github, and excel.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The file paths indicate that the program is likely written in Python, given the `.py` file

Ok. Because our gform of 10th April has old ngrok endpoint which isnt valid now. Only the one which we have emailed to @Jivraj before 10:30 PM is current active. So i conclude our emailed ngrok endpoints of today to @Jivraj are enough.

Sir, I had submitted the project on 31st March at 11:30 PM itself. However, I made a change to the Vercel endpoint and updated it on 1st April. I can provide a screenshot of the Vercel deployment as proof. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt keep a copy of the Google Form submission. But to be honest, I shared the deployed project with some of my friends on 1st and 2nd April, after my edit, and they submitted it through the form after me. They received marks, but I haven‚Äôt received the same.

Sorry, Sir. I just realized the reason why my submission was not considered ‚Äî I had used the email ID I created specifically for my MAD2 project. It was a genuine mistake on my part. However, I noticed in a previous thread that another student who submitted using a different email ID was given a chance to update it. I kindly request you to consider giving me the same opportunity as well.

I have given my endpoint to the gform circulated in this thread.

We didn‚Äôt account for such cases. The purpose of that form was to reevaluate only those who submitted using their IITM email but had provided the wrong endpoint.

Anyone who didn‚Äôt use their IITM email during submission‚Äîeven if they later filled out the form‚Äîwas filtered out and not considered for reevaluation.

Hi @carlton @Saransh_Saini I believe it is a bit late now, but my Programming Quiz score is being displayed as Absent, I remember very well that I got a 4 out of 10, but it has been displaying Absent for a very long time now. This the ROE exam I am talking about here. Kindly fix this issue too.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays text, likely from a UI element showing grades or scores for a student in a course. It appears to be a snippet of a larger interface.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   "PROGRAMMING\_QUIZ\_1 - Absent"
*   "COURSE PROJECT - 35.00"
*   "Course Project Score 2 - 0.00"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The context is likely an academic setting, specifically a student's grades or scores for a programming course. The text indicates that the student was absent for "PROGRAMMING\_QUIZ\_1". They received a score of 35.00 for the "COURSE PROJECT" and a score of 0.00 for "Course Project Score 2".

**4. Technical details:**

There are no technical details visible in the image. It's simply a display of text-based information.

Hi Team,

Yesterday, I received a mail stating that our **Project 2** would be **reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight**, and that the following endpoint would be used to test the API:

 :link:  [https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/](https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/)

However, I have not seen any logs in Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as **0**.

Could you please confirm if my URL was actually reevaluated?

Thank you!

Yesterday I received the mail to start my server from 11 pm to 2 am, but I am very sorry that I did not read the mail on time and hence could not start the server on time. I request you kindly to give a second chance for re evaluation. I have done the project and it would not be fair if it is not evaluated.

**Subject:** Clarification Regarding Project 2 Reevaluation

Hi Team,

I received an email yesterday stating that our Project 2 would be reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight.

However, I haven‚Äôt seen any deployment logs on Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as 0.

My url is working perfectly still there is no logs in the railway.

Could you please confirm whether my Project 2 was actually reevaluated?

Thank you!

@Jivraj  @carlton

I had replied to the email before 11pm with the updated URL as suggested by you in the earlier thread before the form was released.

I submitted the form as soon as I saw the message on discourse which was after 11pm.

**Image: 1000188820**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of a mobile phone screen, likely an email or messaging app. The main content is a Google Form with two questions related to a coding project. The UI elements include:

*   Top bar with time (18:59), battery percentage (98%), and network indicators.
*   Navigation icons: back arrow, download, trash, email, and a three-dot menu.
*   Two question blocks from a Google Form.
*   Bottom bar with icons for microphone, attachment, reply, send, and emoji.
*   A notification icon indicating 99+ unread messages.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Question 1:** "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2? *" (The asterisk indicates a required field).
    *   Instruction: "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name"
    *   Answer provided: "https://github.com/kartikayy1/project2final"
*   **Question 2:** "What is the link to your API endpoint? *"
    *   Instruction: "Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL"
    *   Answer provided: "https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/"
*   "Create your own Google Form"
*   "Does this form look suspicious? Report"
*   "Reply"
*   "99+" (notification count)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows someone filling out a Google Form, likely as part of a project submission or evaluation. The form is requesting the link to the GitHub repository containing the code for "Project 2" and the link to the API endpoint for the project. The instructions emphasize the correct format for the GitHub link and the importance of using the exact API endpoint for POST requests. The presence of "Does this form look suspicious? Report" suggests a concern about potential phishing or malicious forms.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The GitHub link provided follows the standard format: `https://github.com//`. The username is "kartikayy1" and the repository name is "project2final".

**Image: Screenshot_2025-04-17-13-16-34-275_com.google.android.gm**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of an email or a web page displayed on a mobile phone. The content appears to be a form or a notification related to updating URL endpoints. The UI elements include:

*   Top bar with time, network status, battery level, and navigation icons (back, download, delete, forward, and more options).
*   Two distinct sections with text content.
*   A bottom bar with icons for email, messages (with a notification badge indicating 10 unread messages), and video call.
*   Standard Android navigation buttons (back, home, recent apps).

**2. Text Content:**

The visible text content includes:

*   "To streamline the process of URL endpoints changes and accommodate your grievances we have created this form for you to be able to update your endpoints."
*   "Your email (23f1002643@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was recorded when you submitted this form."
*   "Please provide your updated endpoint."
*   "If the endpoint changes, please edit this form that you have already submitted so that we can have the latest endpoint. Do not submit multiple forms."
*   "\*" (likely indicating a required field)
*   "tds-ga-llm.vercel.app/api" (This appears to be a URL)
*   "Create your own Google Form"
*   "Does this form look suspicious? Report"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The content suggests that the user has previously submitted a form with a URL endpoint. The purpose of the displayed content is to allow the user to update their endpoint if it has changed. The email/page emphasizes that the user should edit the existing form rather than submitting multiple forms. The "Does this form look suspicious? Report" suggests a concern about phishing or malicious forms.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The URL "tds-ga-llm.vercel.app/api" indicates that the form or application is likely hosted on Vercel, a platform for deploying web applications. The "api" part suggests that it's an API endpoint.
*   The email address "23f1002643@ds.study.iitm.

Yes, the new page took about 5‚Äì10 seconds to go live after the GitHub repository was created when we used Gmail as a parameter.

If the Gmail is fixed, we can hardcode it in advance.

In our case, Gmail is a parameter, so the function should remain dynamic and it would take 5-10 second to go live after we received answer.

sir my project 2 is also showing 0 but it was working. pls check if it was not working at least give some marks for the effort that w have put. I also accept that we have learnt a lot in this course and marks doesnot matter. but after putting a lot of effort day and night getting a zero, gives a drastic discouragement to even look at the laptop. pls consider if possible.

I have completed and submitted the assigned project 2, and I have verified that it is working correctly as per the given instructions.

However, I noticed that the score awarded to me for the project is 0. I believe this may be an error, as my project meets the required criteria and functions as expected.

I kindly request you to review my submission and let me know if there was any issue during evaluation or submission that may have led to this result.

I have deployed the project on vercel as instructed.

I have uploaded all the links in google form and submitted it.

To support this, I am attaching a screenshot of the PowerShell window that shows an example of my application running successfully for one of the questions.

@carlton  @Jivraj I appreciate the team incorporating my updated response at the endpoint with the ‚Äú/api‚Äù path and re-evaluating accordingly, as well as sharing the results via email.

To my surprise, when I invoke the same endpoint that was evaluated ‚Äî using the correct multipart/form-data payload with both question and file fields ‚Äî I consistently receive a 200 OK response with the expected output.

Moreover, if I omit either field from the form-data, the server returns the exact validation error mentioned in the re-evaluation report, which makes sense. Based on this behavior and the details in the shared report, I‚Äôd like to confirm: during the re-evaluation, was the request payload indeed sent with both question and file fields included in the form-data?

For reference, I‚Äôve attached a screenshot demonstrating the response.

**Image: re-evaluvation-report**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a block of JSON data, likely output from a terminal or console. The JSON represents an array of objects. Each object seems to describe the result of a test or API call.

**2. Text Content:**

The JSON data contains the following key-value pairs within each object:

*   `"api"`:  The value is `"https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/"`. This is a URL, likely the endpoint of an API.
*   `"test_code"`:  The values are strings like `"GA1_q18"`, `"GA4_q6"`, `"GA2_q3"`, `"GA3_q2"`, and `"GA5_q7"`. These likely represent unique identifiers for specific tests.
*   `"status"`: The value is always `"FAILED"`.
*   `"error"`: The value is `"HTTP 400: {\"error\":\"Missing question or file\"}"`. This indicates an HTTP 400 error (Bad Request), with a nested JSON object providing more detail about the error: "Missing question or file".

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The data suggests that a series of tests or API calls were made to the `fileqa-app.vercel.app/api` endpoint. All of these tests failed. The error message "Missing question or file" indicates that the API requires either a question or a file to be provided in the request, and this was not done. The purpose of this output is likely to log or report the results of these failed tests, providing information about the API endpoint, the specific test code, and the reason for the failure.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **JSON Format:** The data is structured using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a common format for data interchange.
*   **HTTP Status Code:** The "HTTP 400" indicates a client-side error, meaning the request sent to the API was malformed or incomplete.
*   **API Endpoint:** The API endpoint is hosted on Vercel, a platform for deploying web applications.
*   **Error Message:** The error message "Missing question or file" is a specific error message returned by the API, indicating the nature

**Image: Screenshot at Apr 17 18-34-30**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) for making an HTTP request, likely from a tool like Postman or Insomnia. It displays the request configuration, including the URL, method, headers, and body. It also shows the response received from the server.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **URL:** `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Tabs:** `Params`, `Authorization`, `Headers (9)`, `Body`, `Scripts`, `Settings`, `Cookies`, `Test Results`
*   **Body Type:** `form-data`
*   **Form Data Fields:**
    *   `Key`: `question`, `Text`, `What is the value in the "answer" column of the ...`
    *   `Key`: `file`, `File`, `abcd.zip`
*   **Response:**
    *   `400 Bad Request`
    *   `{ "error": "Missing question or file" }`
*   **Other UI elements:** `Save`, `Share`, `Send`

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image illustrates a scenario where a user is attempting to send a POST request to an API endpoint (`https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`). The request is using the `form-data` content type. The user is sending a file named `abcd.zip`, but the `question` field is not checked. The server responds with a `400 Bad Request` error, indicating that either the `question` parameter or the `file` parameter is missing.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **HTTP Method:** POST, used to send data to the server to create or update a resource.
*   **Content Type:** `form-data`, used to send data in a format that supports files and other binary data.
*   **Status Code:** `400 Bad Request`, an HTTP status code indicating that the server cannot process the request due to a client error (in this case, missing required parameters).
*   **JSON Response:** The server returns a JSON object with an "error" field, providing a human-readable error message.

**In summary

**Image: Screenshot at Apr 17 18-35-46**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of a Postman-like application interface, likely used for making HTTP requests. The interface is configured to send a POST request to a specific API endpoint. The request body is set to "form-data" and includes fields for "question" and "file". The bottom part of the image displays the JSON response received from the server.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **URL:** `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` (appears twice, once as the base URL and once as the full request URL)
*   **HTTP Method:** POST
*   **Tabs:** Params, Authorization, Headers (9), Body, Scripts, Settings, Cookies
*   **Body Type Options:** none, form-data, x-www-form-urlencoded, raw, binary, GraphQL
*   **Form Data Key-Value Pairs:**
    *   Key: question, Value: What is the value in the "answer" column of the ... (Text)
    *   Key: file, Value: abcd.zip (File)
*   **Response Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Missing question or file"
    }
    ```
*   **Status Code:** 400 Bad Request
*   **Response Time:** 774 ms
*   **Response Size:** 433 B
*   **Other UI elements:** Save, Share, Send

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image illustrates a scenario where a user is attempting to send a POST request to an API endpoint. The request is intended to include both a text question and a file. However, the server is responding with a "400 Bad Request" error, indicating that either the "question" or the "file" parameter is missing or invalid. The red arrows and text annotations indicate that the user is sending the request without the file being properly included. The checkbox next to "file" is unchecked, suggesting that the file is not being sent as part of the request.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

*   The request is using the `form-data` content type, which is

**Image: Success**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of a Postman (or similar API testing tool) interface. It displays a request being configured and the corresponding response received. The request is a POST request to a specific API endpoint. The request body is configured as "form-data" and includes two parameters: "question" (a text field) and "file" (a file upload). The response is shown in JSON format.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **URL:** `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`
*   **HTTP Method:** POST
*   **Tabs:** Params, Authorization, Headers (9), Body, Scripts, Settings, Body, Cookies, Headers (10), Test Results
*   **Body Type:** form-data
*   **Form Data Key-Value Pairs:**
    *   Key: `question`, Value: `What is the value in the "answer" column of the ...`
    *   Key: `file`, Value: `abcd.zip`
*   **JSON Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "answer": "1234567890"
    }
    ```
*   **Response Status:** 200 OK
*   **Response Time:** 868 ms
*   **Response Size:** 410 B
*   **Annotations:**
    *   "Sent req with file/question both"
    *   "Expected res code"
    *   "Expected response"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image likely documents a test case or API interaction. The user is sending a POST request to the specified API endpoint with both a text question and a file. The expected response is a JSON object containing an "answer" field with the value "1234567890". The 200 OK status code indicates that the request was successful. The annotations suggest that this is a documented test case where the user is verifying the API's behavior when both a question and a file are provided.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a snippet of JSON data. The JSON represents an array containing two objects. Each object describes the result of a test run against an API.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The JSON data includes the following key-value pairs within each object:

*   `"api"`: A URL pointing to an API endpoint (e.g., `"https://tds-solver-bml0qi7k5-adityas-projects-07f86c8b.vercel.app/"`).
*   `"test_code"`: A string representing the test code (e.g., `"GA1_q18"`, `"GA4_q6"`).
*   `"status"`: A string indicating the status of the test, which is `"FAILED"` in both cases.
*   `"error"`: A string containing an HTML-formatted error message. The message indicates an HTTP 405 error ("Method Not Allowed"). The HTML includes a `` declaration, an `` tag with `lang="en"`, a `` tag with "405 Method Not Allowed", an `` tag with "Method Not Allowed", and a `
` tag explaining that the method is not allowed for the requested URL.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The JSON data likely represents the output of an automated testing system. The system has run two tests (identified by their test codes) against the specified API. Both tests have failed, and the error message indicates that the HTTP method used in the test is not allowed for the requested URL. This suggests a configuration issue on the API side or an incorrect test setup.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

*   **JSON Format:** The data is structured according to the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, which is commonly used for data interchange.
*   **HTTP Status Code:** The error message includes the HTTP status code 405, which specifically means "Method Not Allowed". This indicates that the server received the request but is refusing to fulfill it because the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) used in the request is not supported for the requested

I would like to highlight an issue regarding the evaluation of the TDS Solver Project 2.

As per the official project instructions, our API was clearly required to handle **POST** requests at /api/ with multipart/form-data.

Nowhere in the documentation was it mentioned that the API should handle **GET** requests.

However, during evaluation, GET requests seem to be made to the endpoint, leading to **405 Method Not Allowed** errors.

These errors are expected behavior for an API that is properly built to accept only POST, exactly as per the project guidelines.

Therefore, I request that the evaluation team **only test using POST requests** as originally instructed.

Penalizing students because of unnecessary GET requests would be **unfair and incorrect** based on the project requirements.

Please ensure that evaluation happens strictly according to the provided instructions.

For further more clarification to prove my endpoint is working as expected.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) of what appears to be an API testing tool, likely Postman or a similar application. The UI is configured to send a POST request to a specific endpoint. The image displays the request configuration, including the URL, request parameters, and the response received from the server.

**2. Text content visible:**

*   **URL:** `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`
*   **HTTP Method:** POST
*   **Tabs:** Params, Authorization, Headers (9), Body, Scripts, Settings, Cookies, Body, Cookies, Headers (10), Test Results
*   **Body Type:** form-data
*   **Form Data:**
    *   Key: `question`, Value: `What is the value in the "answer" column of the ...` (Text)
    *   Key: `file`, Value: `q-move-rename-files.zip` (File) - There's a warning icon next to the filename.
*   **Response:**
    *   `400 Bad Request`
    *   `846 ms` (Response time)
    *   `434 B` (Response size)
    *   JSON Body:
        ```json
        {
          "error": "No CSV file found in zip."
        }
        ```
*   **Annotations:**
    *   "Changed the zip file which doesn't have any CSV." (pointing to the `file` parameter)
    *   "Got the expected error response :)" (pointing to the JSON response)

**3. Context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows a test case where a user is sending a POST request to an API endpoint, likely to upload and process a file. The request includes a question and a ZIP file. The API is expected to process the ZIP file and extract data from a CSV file within it. However, the ZIP file provided does not contain a CSV file. As a result, the API returns a "400 Bad Request" error with the message "No CSV file found in zip." The user seems to have intentionally sent a ZIP file without a CSV to test the error handling of the API.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) of a tool like Postman or Insomnia, used for making HTTP requests. It displays the configuration of a POST request and the response received.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **URL:** `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`
*   **HTTP Method:** POST
*   **Tabs:** Params, Authorization, Headers (9), Body, Scripts, Settings, Cookies, Headers (10), Test Results
*   **Body Type:** form-data
*   **Form Data:**
    *   Key: `question`, Value: `Text`, Description: `What is the value in the "answer" column of the ...`
    *   Key: `file`, Value: `File`, Description: `abcd.zip` (with a warning icon)
*   **Response Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "answer": "3812934199"
    }
    ```
*   **Status:** 200 OK
*   **Time:** 1.16s
*   **Size:** 410 B
*   **Annotations:**
    *   "Updated the zip with new csv file with diff value" (pointing to the `abcd.zip` entry)
    *   "Got expected answer." (pointing to the `"answer": "3812934199"` line in the JSON response)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image captures a scenario where a user is sending a POST request to an API endpoint (`/api/`) to get an answer based on a question and a file. The file (`abcd.zip`) likely contains data (possibly a CSV file) that the API uses to determine the answer. The user has updated the zip file with a new CSV file containing a different value. The JSON response shows the "answer" received from the API, and the user has confirmed that it's the expected answer.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **API Endpoint:** The API endpoint is hosted on Vercel (`fileqa-app.vercel.app`).
*   **Request Type:** The request is a POST request, indicating

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a UI for making an API request, likely from a tool like Postman or Insomnia. It displays the request details, including the URL, method, parameters, and response.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **URL:** `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Request Body:**
    *   `question`: "What is the value in the "answer" column of the..."
    *   `file`: `def.zip` (with a warning icon)
*   **Request Body Type:** `form-data`
*   **Response Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Answer column not found or empty."
    }
    ```
*   Other UI elements: "Params", "Authorization", "Headers (9)", "Body", "Scripts", "Settings", "Save", "Share", "Send", "Cookies", "none", "x-www-form-urlencoded", "raw", "binary", "GraphQL", "Bulk Edit", "Body", "Cookies", "Headers (10)", "Test Results", "JSON", "Preview", "Visualize"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows a user making a POST request to an API endpoint (`https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`). The request includes a question and a file (`def.zip`). The API responds with an error message indicating that the "answer" column was not found or is empty.

Based on the content, it seems the API is designed to process a file (likely a CSV or similar data file) and answer a question based on the data within the file. The error suggests that the file provided either doesn't have a column named "answer" or that the "answer" column is empty.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **API Endpoint:** The API is hosted on Vercel (`vercel.app`).
*   **Request Type:** The request is a `POST` request, indicating that it's likely creating or updating data on the server.
*   **Request Body Format:** The request body is formatted as `form-data`, which is commonly used for sending

If there are any additional scenarios you‚Äôd like me to test, feel free to let me know, I‚Äôd be happy to help validate that the endpoint is functioning as expected. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a JSON object. This object contains information about an API request, including its status and any errors encountered.

**2. Text Content:**

The JSON object contains the following key-value pairs:

*   `"api"`: `"https://roe-i6ghzat4g-manu-cs-projects.vercel.app/api/"`
*   `"test_code"`: `"GA1_q18"`
*   `"status"`: `"ERROR"`
*   `"error"`: `"near \"\`\`\`sql\nSELECT SUM(price * units) AS total_sales\nFROM tickets\nWHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold';\n\`\`\`\": syntax error"`

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The JSON object likely represents the response from an API endpoint. The `"status"` being `"ERROR"` indicates that the API request failed. The `"error"` field provides details about the cause of the failure. In this case, it points to a syntax error in a SQL query.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **JSON:** The data is structured in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, a common format for data interchange on the web.
*   **API Endpoint:** The `"api"` field shows the URL of the API endpoint that was called.
*   **SQL Error:** The `"error"` field contains a SQL query that caused a syntax error. The query attempts to calculate the total sales from a table named "tickets" where the ticket type (converted to lowercase) is equal to "gold". The error message indicates a syntax problem near the SQL code. The error is likely due to the fact that the SQL query is embedded within a string and contains newline characters (`\n`) and backticks (\`\`\`) which are not properly escaped or handled. Also, the single quotes around 'gold' are likely causing issues.

the answer is correct expect for extra spaces it was told that those spaces are neglectable still it showed as error plz consider this @carlton

@Jivraj @carlton

this was one of the question it asked on api

‚Äò‚Äô‚Äò{

‚Äúapi‚Äù: ‚Äú[https://app.algsoch.tech/api/](https://app.algsoch.tech/api/)‚Äù,

},‚Äô‚Äò‚Äô

Now I am demonstrating that my HTML page includes an email tag. You can see it here.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a "Get In Touch" section, likely from a website or digital profile. It includes contact information and social media links.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **"Get In Touch"** (Large, bold text, likely a heading)
*   **"Feel free to reach out for collaborations or just a friendly chat!"** (A welcoming message)
*   **"Email: 24f2006438@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"** (An email address)

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The purpose of this section is to provide visitors with ways to contact the person or organization associated with the website/profile. It encourages communication for collaborations or casual conversation.

**4. UI Elements:**

*   Three circular icons are displayed at the bottom. These are social media icons. From left to right, they appear to be:
    *   GitHub (Cat icon)
    *   LinkedIn (in icon)
    *   Twitter (Bird icon)

**5. Color Scheme:**

The background color is a shade of blue. The text and icons are white or a lighter shade of blue, providing good contrast.

‚Äúapi‚Äù: ‚Äú[https://app.algsoch.tech/api/](https://app.algsoch.tech/api/)‚Äù,

‚Äútest_code‚Äù: ‚ÄúGA4_q6‚Äù,

‚Äústatus‚Äù: ‚ÄúFAILED‚Äù,

}

I am unsure of the exact question, but it seems that the question can be modified with search terms and points. For example, in the account, it was stated as [‚Äòtext editor‚Äô, at least 77 points‚Äô]. If this were the parameter, then my answer would be correct, and I have proof.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) of what appears to be a search results page from "Hacker News". It displays search results for the query "https://github.com/sminez/ad". The results are presented as a list of entries, each representing a submission or post. Each entry includes a title, a link (likely to a GitHub repository), the number of points, the username of the submitter, the time since submission, and the number of comments.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Header:** "Search Hacker News" with a search bar containing the text "https://github.com/sminez/ad".
*   **Search Filters:** "Search", "Stories", "by Popularity", "for All time".
*   **Search Results:**
    *   "Ad: An Adaptable Text Editor (https://github.com/sminez/ad)" (appears twice)
    *   "142 points | xelxebar | 4 months ago | 61 comments"
    *   "5 points | todsacerdoti | 8 months ago | 1 comments"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows the results of a search on Hacker News for a specific GitHub repository or project related to "sminez/ad". The results are displayed as advertisements ("Ad:") suggesting that these entries might be promoted or sponsored content. The purpose is to present relevant links to the user based on their search query.

**4. Technical details (if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram):**

There is no code or technical diagram in the image. It's a UI screenshot of a search results page. The highlighted text "https://github.com/sminez/ad" indicates that the search query is specifically targeting a GitHub repository or project. The "points" and "comments" metrics suggest that the results are ranked or sorted based on user engagement.

and this

‚Äústatus‚Äù: ‚ÄúFAILED‚Äù,

‚Äúactual‚Äù: 125,

‚Äúexpected‚Äù: ‚ÄúRange: 55 to 65‚Äù

Case 3: JSON Key Count ‚Äì XF Parameter (GA5_q7)

{

‚Äúapi‚Äù: ‚Äú[https://app.algsoch.tech/api/](https://app.algsoch.tech/api/)‚Äù,

‚Äútest_code‚Äù: ‚ÄúGA5_q7‚Äù,

‚Äústatus‚Äù: ‚ÄúERROR‚Äù,

‚Äúerror‚Äù: ‚Äúinvalid literal for int() with base 10: ‚ÄòError: Invalid JSON in the file. Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)‚Äô‚Äù

}

 :memo:  What Was Expected:

The question required developing a script that:

Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and

Counts how many times a specific key ‚Äî represented by XF ‚Äî appears in the JSON structure.

It was explicitly stated that:

Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values.

The file to be used was:

E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json

 :white_check_mark:  What I Did:

I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure.

Here‚Äôs the actual response I got using this cURL command:

curl -X POST [https://app.algsoch.tech/api/](https://app.algsoch.tech/api/) \

-H ‚Äúaccept: application/json‚Äù \

-F ‚Äúquestion=‚Ä¶How many times does XF appear as a key?‚Äù \

-F ‚Äúfile=@E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json‚Äù

API Output:{‚Äúanswer‚Äù:‚Äú14602‚Äù}

This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended.

 :warning:  What Went Wrong on API Side:

The API returned a parsing error, indicating:

‚Äúinvalid literal for int() with base 10: ‚ÄòError: Invalid JSON in the file‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù

However:

My file was valid JSON, properly parsed.

The actual issue seems to be on the API‚Äôs side ‚Äî possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator.

It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash.

 :light_bulb:  Insight:

If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct.

However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a JSON-formatted data structure. It appears to be a response from an API, indicating an error during a test.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The JSON data contains the following key-value pairs:

*   `"api": "https://roe-i6ghzat4g-manu-cs-projects.vercel.app/api/"`
*   `"test_code": "GA1_q18"`
*   `"status": "ERROR"`
*   `"error": "near \"\`\`\`sql\nSELECT SUM (price * units) AS total\_sales\nFROM tickets\nWHERE LOWER (type) = 'gold';\n\`\`\`\": syntax error"`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The JSON data represents the result of a test case (`test_code: "GA1_q18"`) against an API endpoint (`api: "https://roe-i6ghzat4g-manu-cs-projects.vercel.app/api/"`). The test resulted in an error (`status: "ERROR"`). The `"error"` field provides details about the error, indicating a syntax error in a SQL query.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

The `"error"` field contains a SQL query that is causing a syntax error. The query attempts to calculate the total sales of tickets where the ticket type (converted to lowercase) is 'gold'. The query is:

```sql
SELECT SUM (price * units) AS total_sales
FROM tickets
WHERE LOWER (type) = 'gold';
```

The error message "near ... syntax error" suggests that the SQL query has a syntax problem. The exact location of the error is not explicitly stated, but it's likely related to the `WHERE` clause or the semicolon at the end of the query within the string. The presence of `\n` suggests that the query was formatted with newlines, which might be causing issues when interpreted.

in this question even though the answer is correct except those extra spaces it has been showing error plz check into this @carlton @Jivraj

I had completed project 2 but because of a mistake i filled the form with my personal mail id fue to which the project eas not evaluated i fully consider this to be my fault and assure that something like this will not happen in the future .

If my evaluation of project 2 is not done then i will fail the tds course and will have to repeat this course which will cause a financial strain on me

I know that it is difficult for you to consider this request but it is my humblest request if you can just look through the project i tried to complete the project with the best of my abilities

It will be really helpful if you can access the project

My git repository link is - GitHub - kartikayy1/project2final

My vercel link is - [https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/](https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/)

Good Afternoon Sir.

This is regarding project 1 and project 2.

**Project-1 Evaluation**

Sir, For the project 1, I have written the code, uploaded in GitHub and the dockerfile image is created and uploaded successfully.

Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn‚Äôt get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully.

**Project-2 Evaluation**

Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage.

Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks.

In anticipation of quick response

Thank You

Hi everyone,

I know that some of you might be feeling anxious about your scores etc. We are currently in the process of validating your scores on all the projects, roe, assignments, exam and bonus, so we will not be able to respond quickly to each individual post here for the time being.

Once we validate, you will receive an email with your official scores that we will be pushing to Operations in a single update. Along with that email you will receive a discrepancy form where you can raise your issues. This will give us a consolidated view of problems and fix them.

Kindly wait for the email to come to you. It will be sent sometime this afternoon.

Kind regards,

TDS Team

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of a Gmail inbox, specifically an email related to "TDS Project 2 Endpoints." The email contains a message and a form for updating endpoints. The Gmail interface is visible, including the inbox, compose button, labels, and search bar.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Email Subject:** TDS Project 2 Endpoints
*   **Email Body:**
    *   "Dear Learner,"
    *   "Due to some major operational changes in the backend, we have had some unforeseen delays in conducting the evaluations of Project 2 Endpoints. As a result, some of you, have had to restart your servers or enact some other changes to your servers in order to keep the endpoints alive. This may have resulted in your URLs changing."
    *   "To streamline the process of URL endpoints changes and accommodate your grievances we have created this form for you to be able to update your endpoints."
    *   "Your email address (23f1002942@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was recorded when you submitted this form."
    *   "Please provide your updated endpoint."

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The email is a communication to learners (likely students) involved in "Project 2" related to TDS (possibly a course or project management system). The email informs them about operational changes that may have affected their project endpoints (URLs). It provides a form for them to update their endpoints if necessary. The email emphasizes the importance of updating the existing form rather than submitting multiple forms.

Dear Team,

this is proof that I have successfully submitted the form and the api is still working, why am i still marked as absent? Please respond my email is 23f1002942@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

Why am my I getting `GET` request to my api endpoint? It must be IITM‚Äôs http request because I have not shared it with anyone.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a log output, likely from a web server or network monitoring tool. The log entries are formatted in a consistent manner, showing timestamps (IP addresses and port numbers), log levels (INFO or WARNING), HTTP request details, and HTTP status codes.

**2. Text Content:**

The text content consists of log entries with the following structure:

*   **Log Level:** "INFO:" or "WARNING:"
*   **IP Address and Port:**  A numerical IP address followed by a colon and a port number (e.g., "123.160.223.72:54416").
*   **HTTP Request:**  A string enclosed in double quotes, representing an HTTP request.  Examples include:
    *   `"GET / HTTP/1.1"`
    *   `"GET /login HTTP/1.1"`
    *   `"GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1"`
    *   `"GET /squid-internal-mgr/cachemgr.cgi HTTP/1.1"`
    *   `"PRI %2A HTTP/2.0"`
    *   `"CONNECT www.shadowserver.org%3A443 HTTP/1.1"`
    *   `"GET http%3A//api.ipify.org/?format=json HTTP/1.1"`
*   **HTTP Status Code:** "404 Not Found"
*   **"Invalid HTTP request received."**

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The log entries indicate that the server is receiving HTTP requests. The "INFO:" entries show successful logging of requests, while "WARNING:" entries indicate that an invalid HTTP request was received. The "404 Not Found" status code suggests that the requested resources were not found on the server.

The purpose of this log output is likely for debugging, monitoring server activity, and identifying potential issues such as broken links, unauthorized access attempts, or malformed requests.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **HTTP Methods:** The log entries show "GET" and "CONNECT" HTTP methods.  "GET" is used to retrieve resources, while "CONNECT" is used to establish a network connection (often

It clearly written in the project 2 in TDS portal that api  must  accept  `POST` request, not `GET`.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a snippet of documentation or a tutorial. It includes explanatory text and a code example demonstrating how to make a POST request to an API endpoint using the `curl` command. The code is presented within a dark-themed code block.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Explanatory Text:**
    *   "Your application exposes an API endpoint. Let's assume that it is at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`."
    *   "The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/` with the question as well as optional file attachments as multipart/form-data."
    *   "For example, here's how anyone can make a request:"
*   **Code Block (bash):**
    *   `curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \`
    *   `-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \`
    *   `-F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is t`
    *   `-F "file=@abcd.zip"`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The content aims to guide a user on how to interact with an API endpoint. The API expects a POST request with a question and potentially a file attachment. The `curl` command provides a concrete example of how to construct such a request, including setting the content type to `multipart/form-data` and attaching a file named "abcd.zip". The question parameter seems to be related to the content of the zip file.

**4. Technical details (code screenshot):**

*   **`curl` command:** This is a command-line tool used for making HTTP requests.
*   **`-X POST`:** Specifies that the request method is POST.
*   **`"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/"`:** The URL of the API endpoint.
*   **`-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"`:** Sets the Content-Type header to indicate that the request body is in multipart/form-

It is requested to kindly look into this matter and please clarify.

I had completed project 2 but because of a mistake i filled the form with my personal mail id fue to which the project eas not evaluated i fully consider this to be my fault and assure that something like this will not happen in the future .

If my evaluation of project 2 is not done then i will fail the tds course and will have to repeat this course which will cause a financial strain on me

I know that it is difficult for you to consider this request but it is my humblest request if you can just look through the project i tried to complete the project with the best of my abilities

It will be really helpful if you can access the project

My git repository link is - GitHub - kartikayy1/project2final

My vercel link is - [https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/](https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/)

I am also receiving the odd GET requests, however, I don‚Äôt believe these are being sent by the evaluation teams. Our endpoints are open to internet and there are bots everywhere which will send these kind of random requests to scan for potential exploit/hacking targets.

Just recieved this on my mail. Happy that everything worked out pretty well w/o the need for hardcoding. I‚Äôm guessing GA1-q18 bugged out because of escape sequences in the codeblock  :joy:  That‚Äôs LLMs for you!

Can‚Äôt expect 100% reliability, even at 0 temperature.

**Image: 1000040555**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a JSON file content. It appears to be a log or report of some automated tests. The JSON structure is an array of objects, where each object represents a test result.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **File Name:** "22f3001642.json" (at the top of the image)
*   **JSON Structure:** The JSON data includes key-value pairs within objects, and the objects are contained within an array.
*   **Keys:** "test\_code", "status", "error"
*   **Values:**
    *   "GA1\_q18", "GA2\_q3", "GA3\_q2", "GA4\_q6", "GA5\_q7" (for "test\_code")
    *   "ERROR", "PASSED" (for "status")
    *   A multi-line string containing an SQL query and an error message (for "error" in the first object)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The JSON data represents the results of a series of tests. Each test is identified by a "test\_code". The "status" indicates whether the test passed or resulted in an error. The first test ("GA1\_q18") resulted in an "ERROR", and the "error" field provides details about the error, which appears to be a syntax error in an SQL query. The other tests ("GA2\_q3", "GA3\_q2", "GA4\_q6", "GA5\_q7") all "PASSED".

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

*   **JSON Format:** The data is structured according to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) standards, which is a common format for data interchange.
*   **SQL Query:** The "error" field in the first object contains an SQL query:
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales
    FROM tickets
    WHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold';
    ```
    The query calculates the total sales for tickets of type 'gold'.
*   **Error Message:** The error message "near \`

*   **Indicator:** "Correct"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image is part of an exercise or quiz where the user is asked to identify or construct a valid GitHub Pages URL. The example URL provided (https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/) shows the general structure of a GitHub Pages URL, where "[USER]" is the GitHub username and "[REPO]" is the repository name. The user has entered a URL in the input field, and the system has indicated that the entered URL is "Correct".

**4. Technical details:**

The example URL "https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/" is a common format for GitHub Pages URLs. The URL in the input field "https://23f2004837.github.io/" is a valid GitHub Pages URL, but it is not in the standard format. It is likely a URL for a GitHub Pages site that is not associated with a specific repository.

Please let me know what can I do get the evaluation logs.

I would like to bring to your attention that the project URL I submitted was accessible and working correctly in my browser, even without the ‚Äúhttp‚Äù or ‚Äúhttps‚Äù prefix. A friend of mine submitted a similar URL and received full marks. Furthermore, I have updated my URL using HTTPS via Google Forms, so I kindly request you to consider evaluating my project using the latest URL provided.

This is a humble request, as I am currently at risk of receiving a grade ‚ÄòE‚Äô, which will significantly impact my overall CGPA. As an alternative, I am also willing to retake the course in the next term and pay the fee again if needed.

In the P1, unfortunately scored zero due to a minor mistake and was not given an opportunity to correct it. I truly believe that in real-life scenarios, we are often given chances to rectify such errors, and I sincerely hope for the same consideration here.

**Subject:** Request to Share My Student-Built TDS Assistant Platform

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope you‚Äôre doing well.

I‚Äôm **Vicky Kumar**, a student from the Data Science and Applications program at **IIT Madras**. Over the last few months, I‚Äôve built a personal project called **‚ÄúVicky App‚Äù** ‚Äî a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like **TDS,**.

The system is capable of:

Accurately solving over **90% of assignment-style questions** using regex and phonetic matching
Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student‚Äôs input
Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON
Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM

You can test the platform here: [https://app.algsoch.tech](https://app.algsoch.tech)

 :light_bulb:  What‚Äôs in it for students:

They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically
Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload
I‚Äôve made it **free for the first 3 questions**
After that, students can access the full platform for just **‚Çπ199/month**, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs

 :folded_hands:  My Humble Request:

This is a tool I‚Äôve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students.

To sustain the platform ‚Äî hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration ‚Äî I‚Äôve introduced a small paid model after a free trial.

I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement.

It‚Äôs built *by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students* ‚Äî with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter.

Thank you so much for your time and support.

Warm regards,

**Vicky Kumar**
