**Image: Screenshot 2025-03-02 at 12.21.11 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a table with information about courses, their timings, and exam links. It also includes some instructions and a note about the time zone.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Header:** "Date: March 02nd 2025"
*   **Table Headers:**
    *   "COURSE NAME"
    *   "TIMING"
    *   "EXAM LINK"
*   **Table Rows:**
    *   "Python A1 (P1 to P64)" - "09:30 AM to 11:30 AM" - "CLOSED"
    *   "Python A2 (P65 to P128)" - "09:30 AM to 11:30 AM" - "CLOSED"
    *   "Java" - "09:30 AM to 11:00 AM" - "CLOSED"

The "CLOSED" status for some exam links suggests that those exams might have already taken place or are not yet available.

Its fine the link is correct. Just that the exam is not available at the moment, we have changed the error message. Exam will start at 1pm. Its also hackable to start before.

Your answer is absolutely correct @23f2000573

But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.

Hello Sir"s, @carlton @Saransh_Saini

I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.

My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.

I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **UI Elements:** The image shows a section of a user interface, likely from a web application or software program. It includes a heading, a button, and some descriptive text.

2.  **Text Content:**
    *   **Heading:** "Recent saves (most recent is your" - This suggests the section displays a list of recently saved items or versions. The sentence is incomplete.
    *   **Button:** "Reload" - A button labeled "Reload," likely used to refresh the list of recent saves or revert to a specific save.
    *   **Date/Time:** "from 3/2/2025, 1:47:43 PM. S" - This indicates the date and time of a specific save, in this case, March 2nd, 2025, at 1:47:43 PM. The sentence is incomplete.

3.  **Context/Purpose:** The purpose of this UI element is to allow the user to manage and potentially revert to previous versions or saves of their work. The "Recent saves" heading provides context, and the "Reload" button offers a way to load a specific save.

4.  **Technical Details:** The image doesn't provide specific technical details about the underlying code or implementation. However, it's likely that the "Reload" button triggers a function that retrieves the data associated with the selected save from a database or file system. The date and time information is probably stored as a timestamp and formatted for display.

Kind Regards,

Muthu

Hello @carlton / @Saransh_Saini

I tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on the last two.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) element, likely from a web application or similar system. It displays login information, a logout button, and a list of recent saves with associated data.

**2. Text Content:**

*   "You are logged in as 22f1000535@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."
*   "Logout"
*   "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)"
*   "Reload from 3/2/2025, 3:16:50 AM. Score: 8"
*   "Reload from 3/2/2025, 3:15:46 AM. Score: 8"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The UI appears to be part of a system where users log in and their progress or data is saved. The "Recent saves" section provides a history of saves, including the date, time, and a score. The "Logout" button allows the user to end their session. The context suggests a learning platform or a game where scores are tracked.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The UI elements are simple, with a clear hierarchy.
*   The "Reload" text is likely a clickable link or button, indicated by the blue color.
*   The date and time format is "MM/DD/YYYY, HH:MM:SS AM/PM".
*   The email address "22f1000535@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" suggests an academic institution (IITM).
*   The background color is dark, with light text for readability.
*   The "Recent saves" section is enclosed in a dark green box.

I understand I should have submitted more frequently, but those final 5 minutes flew by like the fastest 5 minutes of my life.

Please consider accepting my submission

Thanks so much and best regards,

**Image: image**
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**1. UI Elements and Content:**

*   **Terminal Output:** The image primarily shows output from a terminal or command-line interface.
*   **Package Installation:** The initial lines indicate that Python packages are being installed or verified. Specifically, it shows that `tabula-py`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `distro`, `python-dateutil`, `pytz`, `tzdata`, and `six` are already installed and satisfy the required versions. The paths to these packages are also displayed (e.g., `/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages`).
*   **File Upload:** There's a "Choose files" button, suggesting a file upload operation. The file `q-extract-ta...m-pdf (2).pdf` is selected.
*   **File Processing:** The line `q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2).pdf(application/pdf) - 167477 bytes, last modified: 02/03/2025 - 100% done` indicates that a PDF file named "q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2).pdf" has been uploaded and processed. The file size and last modified date are also shown.
*   **Saving Output:** The line `Saving q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2).pdf to q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2) (1).pdf` suggests that the processed data is being saved to a new PDF file.
*   **Warnings:** There are warning messages related to the `tabula` library and font handling. These warnings indicate that the library encountered an issue and is using fallback fonts (LiberationSans) for "Symbol" and "ZapfDingbats".
*   **Data Table:** A table is displayed, likely extracted from the PDF. The table has columns labeled "Maths", "Physics", "English", "Economics", "Biology", and "Group". There are 5 rows of numerical data (indexed 0-4).
*   **Data Types:** Below the table, the data types of each column are listed as "int64". The overall data type of the table is "object".

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Package Names and Versions:** `tabula

!pip install tabula-py
import tabula
import pandas as pd
from google.colab import files

# Path to the PDF file
pdf_path = pdf_path = list(files.upload().keys())[0]

# Extract tables from the PDF, specifying pages and multiple_tables=True
tables = tabula.read_pdf(pdf_path, pages="all", multiple_tables=True)

# Initialize an empty list to store all DataFrames
all_dfs = []

# Iterate through each table and add a "Group" column based on the page number
for i, table in enumerate(tables):
    # Add a "Group" column to the table
    table["Group"] = i + 1  # Group 1 for Page 1, Group 2 for Page 2, etc.
    # Append the table to the list
    all_dfs.append(table)

# Combine all DataFrames into a single DataFrame
df = pd.concat(all_dfs, ignore_index=True)

# Rename columns for easier access (if necessary)
df.columns = ["Maths", "Physics", "English", "Economics", "Biology", "Group"]

# Convert marks to numerical data types
df["Maths"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Maths"], errors="coerce")
df["Physics"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Physics"], errors="coerce")
df["English"] = pd.to_numeric(df["English"], errors="coerce")
df["Economics"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Economics"], errors="coerce")
df["Biology"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Biology"], errors="coerce")
df["Group"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Group"], errors="coerce")

# Drop rows with missing values (if any)
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Display the first few rows of the combined DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Display the data types of the columns
print(df.dtypes)
filtered_df = df[(df["Biology"] >= 30) & (df["Group"].between(1, 28))]

total_biology_marks = filtered_df["Maths"].sum()
print(total_biology_marks)

Ignore the variables name, i got my value as 34919

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a question and answer section, likely from an online quiz or educational platform. It includes a question, a text input field for the answer, and an error message.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Question:** "What is the total Biology marks of students who scored 30 or more marks in Maths in groups 1-28 (including both groups)?"
*   **Input Field:** "34919" (This is the user's answer)
*   **Error Message:** "Incorrect. Try again."

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The image depicts a question from a quiz or assignment where the user is asked to calculate the total Biology marks based on certain criteria related to Maths scores and group membership. The user has entered an answer ("34919"), but the system has flagged it as incorrect.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The input field has a red border, indicating an error or invalid input.
*   There's a small icon with an exclamation mark inside a circle next to the input field, further emphasizing the error.
*   The words "Biology" and "Maths" are highlighted in a different color (likely pink or purple) to draw attention to them.
*   The number "30" and the range "1-28" are also highlighted in the same color.

i dont understand why its wrong

Hello @carlton / @Saransh_Saini

I  am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today’s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.

I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.

Could you please consider my request?

Thank you.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. UI Elements:**

*   **Browser Interface:** The top of the image shows a standard web browser interface with the back, forward, and refresh buttons. The address bar displays the URL: `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe`.
*   **Alert/Notification Bar:** A red bar spans the top of the content area, indicating an alert or notification.
*   **"Recent Saves" Section:** A dark green box contains a list of recent saves. Each save entry has a "Reload" button and information about the save time and score.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Alert Bar:** "Ended at Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 pm IST" and "Score: 0"
*   **"Recent Saves" Heading:** "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)"
*   **Save Entries:**
    *   "Reload from 3/2/2025, 1:41:37 PM. Score: 10" (appears twice)
    *   "Reload from 3/2/2025, 1:41:33 PM. Score: 10"

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an online exam or assessment platform. The red alert bar indicates that the exam has ended. The "Recent Saves" section displays a history of saved progress during the exam, along with the score achieved at each save point. The note "(most recent is your official score)" suggests that the most recent save is the final score for the exam.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The URL `exam.sanand.workers.dev` suggests a development or testing environment for an exam platform.
*   The `tds-2025-01-roe` part of the URL likely refers to a specific test or exam instance, possibly related to the year 2025.
*   The timestamps indicate the exact date and time of each save.
*   The "Score: 10" values suggest that the user achieved a score of 10 on each save.
*   The final score is 0, which means that the most

Sir, I’m facing the same issue. While the recent scores say I have a score of 10, my final score shows 0. Kindly look into this, and please consider the highest marks from recent saves.

Thank you.

Charging wasnt an issue for me, my entire vsc just froze and the screen went blank during the last 5 mins. That was exactly when i got the code for q6 and was trying to get the output and it froze, reopened at 1:45 and the time was up

Hi @21f3002158

I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam.

Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.

There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this.

Kind regards

@carlton  @Jivraj sir,  I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and  finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that

Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process

Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity

**Image: 1000032006**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web page, likely a quiz or exam interface. It includes UI elements such as buttons, links, and text. The page appears to be part of an online assessment platform.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **URL:** `https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe`
*   **Header:** "Ended at Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 pm IST"
*   **Score:** "Score: 9/10"
*   **Buttons:** "Check all", "Save", "Logout", "Reload"

    *   "from 2/3/2025, 1:47:28 pm. Score: 9"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The page is likely a student's view after completing an online exam or quiz. The "Ended at..." message indicates the exam is over. The score is displayed, and there are options to "Check all" (presumably answers) and "Save". The instructions about filling out a form for a bonus mark suggest an opportunity for extra credit. The links to Discourse and Google Meet provide support channels for students, specifically IITM students. The "Recent saves" section shows the

Ok sir

Also I have realised the value of 28 seconds since my last submission (9/10) was at 1:47:28

I respect the rules of the exam and will be more careful in the future exams to avoid such technical glitches.

When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-03-02 134049**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) for an online exam or assessment. It includes elements such as:

*   A timer indicating the time remaining ("00:04:19 left").
*   A score indicator ("Score: 1/10").
*   A refresh/retry icon and a "Save" button.
*   A question prompt with an input field for the answer.
*   A "Check" button to submit the answer.
*   An error message box.
*   A dark mode toggle.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   "00:04:19 left"
*   "Score: 1/10"
*   "Save"
*   "What is the Pearson correlation coefficient between columns A and B?"
*   "Checking..."
*   "Calculate the sample correlation coefficient using Python, Excel, or JavaScript. The data doesn't have any missing values. Write the answer rounded to 3 decimal places, e.g. -0.769."
*   "Check"
*   "Save"
*   "Error!"
*   "Failed to fetch"
*   "Please contact the exam team for assistance."
*   "Save regularly. Your last saved submission will be evaluated."

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The UI is part of an online exam or assessment where the user is being asked to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between two columns of data (A and B). The user is instructed to use Python, Excel, or JavaScript for the calculation and to provide the answer rounded to 3 decimal places. The "Checking..." message indicates that the system is currently processing the user's input. The error message "Failed to fetch" suggests that there was a problem retrieving data or submitting the answer, possibly due to a network issue or server-side error.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The question requires the user to calculate a statistical measure (Pearson correlation coefficient).
*   The instructions specify that the data has no missing values, simplifying the calculation.
*   The user is given the flexibility to use different tools (Python, Excel, JavaScript) to perform the calculation.
*   The error message

Hi @23f2004781

I looked for your submissions in backend and can’t find any submission.

 23f2004781:

There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive.

There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn’t join technical support meet before deadline.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

*   The image shows a UI element, specifically a rectangular box with a teal border. Inside the box, there are two lines of text and a speech bubble icon.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **"Have questions? Join Discourse (IITM students only)"**
*   **"Techical issues? OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet (IITM students only)"**

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

*   The UI element appears to be a call-to-action or information box. It's likely part of a website or application designed for IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) students.
*   The box provides options for students to seek help or ask questions. It suggests using Discourse for general questions and Google Meet for technical issues.
*   The text explicitly states that these resources are intended for IITM students only.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The text "Join Discourse" and "Join Google Meet" are likely hyperlinks, indicated by the underlining.
*   The word "OPTIONAL" is used to indicate that joining the Google Meet for technical issues is not mandatory.
*   The speech bubble icon visually represents communication or discussion.
*   The background color is a dark gray or black, while the text and border are teal, providing good contrast and readability.

Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help with it.

I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow.

Hi @Jayeshbansal

Until not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.

I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.

i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before)

Hi @Jayeshbansal

After deadline we gave allowance for 2 minutes considering network issues students might have faced, so till 1:47:00 all submissions will be considered valid, after that we won’t take any submissions.

yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save

Hi @23f3002537

The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version.

from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}

Hello @Jivraj sir,

Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.

I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic.

Please re consider this request sir.

@Jivraj Could you please verify if my score will be accepted by you? I saved only once: at 1:47 pm. My roll number is 21f2001573.

I checked your submission, its at 1:47:30 PM. We are going to give a grace period of 2 minutes past 1:45 PM. Given that you submitted 30 seconds past 1:47, we won’t be able to consider it.

Regards

Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47).

Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered.

I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm.

Please reconsider if possible.

They only started pushing the scores a few minutes ago, so just wait for the update to finish. Check again and confirm after a few hours.

Thanks

Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded. Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to be implemented.

Respected Sir,

I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.

Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.

Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.

Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted

**Image: Screenshot 2025-03-09 at 2.42.50 pm**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows what appears to be a table or a list of data entries. Each entry has three columns.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The text content is as follows:

*   **Row 1:**
    *   Column 1: 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
    *   Column 2: 2025-03-02 17:51:08
    *   Column 3: 4
*   **Row 2:**
    *   Column 1: 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
    *   Column 2: 2025-03-02 13:45:05
    *   Column 3: 3

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The data likely represents some kind of log or record. The first column appears to be an email address associated with a student at IIT Madras (iitm.ac.in). The second column is a timestamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. The third column is a numerical value, possibly an ID, a count, or a score.

**4. Technical details:**

The data is presented in a tabular format, suggesting it could be from a database, a log file, or a spreadsheet. The consistent format of the email address and timestamp indicates a structured data source.

The latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks. That is what would be considered.
