Hi @carlton,

I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a spreadsheet, likely from Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. It contains data related to the Producer Price Index (PPI) for the pharmaceutical industry. The data is organized in rows and columns.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The spreadsheet contains the following text:

*   **Column A (Labels):**
    *   PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations, not seasonally adjusted
    *   Series Title
    *   Series ID
    *   Seasonality
    *   Survey Name
    *   Measure Data Ty
    *   Industry
    *   Item
    *   -
    *   PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Calcium channel blockers, not seasonally adjusted
    *   Series Title
    *   Series ID
    *   Seasonality
    *   Survey Name
    *   Measure Data Ty
    *   Industry
    *   Item

*   **Column B (Values):**
    *   PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations, not seasonally adjusted
    *   PCU3254123254127111
    *   Not Seasonally Adjusted
    *   PPI Industry Data
    *   Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations
    *   Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing
    *   Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations
    *   PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Calcium channel blockers, not seasonally adjusted
    *   PCU3254123254127114
    *   Not Seasonally Adjusted
    *   PPI Industry Data
    *   Calcium channel blockers
    *   Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing
    *   Calcium channel blockers

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The spreadsheet appears to be a data extract or summary related to PPI for specific pharmaceutical preparations. It provides metadata about the data series, including:

*   **Series Title:** A descriptive name for the data series.
*   **Series ID:** A unique identifier for the data series.
*   **Seasonality:** Indicates whether

In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are

**Image: {7059D6FF-DF75-4B21-999A-29D23A297A90}**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a line of text describing the structure of a spreadsheet.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The text reads: "4. Sheet1: Columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value."

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The text describes the column headers present in a spreadsheet named "Sheet1". The columns are:
*   Series ID
*   Item
*   Year
*   Month
*   Value

This suggests that the spreadsheet contains time-series data related to different items, with a unique identifier for each series, and a value associated with each item for a given year and month.

**4. Technical details:**

There are no technical details in the image.

but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”

**Image: {F9711583-E074-489A-AC90-154B9309F786}**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a snippet of a spreadsheet or table. It contains data organized into columns and rows. The columns are labeled with headers.

**2. Any text content visible:**

Here's a breakdown of the text content:

*   **Column Headers:**
    *   Series ID
    *   Year
    *   Period
    *   Label
    *   Value

*   **Data Rows:**
    *   Row 1: PCU3254-3254-, 2023, M01, 2023 Jan, 562.445

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The data appears to be time-series data, likely related to some kind of economic or statistical tracking.

*   "Series ID" likely identifies a specific data series.
*   "Year" and "Period" specify the time period for the data. The "Period" column uses a shorthand notation (e.g., "M01" for January).
*   "Label" provides a more human-readable description of the time period.
*   "Value" represents the numerical value of the data for that series and time period.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

This is not a code screenshot or technical diagram. It's a data table, likely from a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets.

Below items don’t have prices.

PCU3254123254127111
Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations

PCU3254123254127114
Calcium channel blockers

PCU325412325412MM
Miscellaneous receipts

PCU325412325412D112OC
Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter

PCU325412325412D113
Antacids

PCU325412325412SS
Secondary products

PCU3254123254127112
ACE inhibitors

Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.

Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

[Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OrkZgDnx7uYjOxFW2XDrA5F0xFre_PCS/view?usp=drive_link)

Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?

Hi Tanya,

Both you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just the way google forms works, it does not reload your previous responses.

The question asked for top 5 countries. So that would be the approach for this question, not aggregated economic groups.

Hi @carlton sir,

I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.

Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?

Sir,

In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%.

In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?

Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.

If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest **and** yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate.

Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another.

You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission.
