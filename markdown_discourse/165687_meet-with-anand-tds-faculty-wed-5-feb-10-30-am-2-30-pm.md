I will be at the IIT Madras campus next Wednesday (5 Feb) from 10:30 am to 2:30 pm IST.

I’ll be at the NAC (New Academic Complex) or the NAC footsteps.

If anyone would like to chat - about TDS, or anything else - you’re welcome.

Thank you for taking out time to meet today. It was great to meet you Sir, and was a great pleasant surprise to meet our wonderful TAs, @carlton and @jivraj (and, TAs for Java and Statistics I too. sorry, I am unable to tag them with names) as well. I am inspired to continue learning deeper and more… such interactions are very helpful. Thank you.
