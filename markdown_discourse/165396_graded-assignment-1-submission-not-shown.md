Hello,

I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still?

@Muthupalaniappan

It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question.

You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading.

Kind regards

Dear Sir,

I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?

Hello,

I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9,  so I kindly request you to consider it and provide your clarification on the matter.

Respected Sir,

I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal

According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?

Thanks

@23f2005471

Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).

Dear @s.anand sir,

For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link) that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time??

I will make sure I submit it in both places next time.

I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact my grade particularly as of this course.

I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image attached below I erred up with this submission

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The use of color (red for incorrect feedback, green for the correct answer) provides visual cues to the user.
*   The underlined "this link" indicates a hyperlink, likely leading to the Graded Assignment 1.

    *   "6. Use anything. You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want."

Hi Mandy,

Your scores will be pushed to the Dashboard from your saved submissions. Ignore the seek Portal result (that was a placeholder question to make students aware that GA had been released).

I have done my GA1 and scored 10/10 still it’s showing 0 on my dashboard.

**Image: GA1**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web page, likely part of an online exam or coding challenge platform. It displays a code snippet, a correctness indicator, instructions, and submission-related messages. The UI elements include text fields, buttons ("Check", "Save"), and status messages.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **URL:** exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1
*   **Due Date:** Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST
*   **Score:** Score: 10/10
*   **Code Snippet:**
    *   FROM tickets
    *   WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';
*   **Correctness Indicator:** Correct
*   **Instructions:** Get all rows where the Type is "Gold". Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as "Gold". Calculate the sales as Units
*   **Submission Message:**
    *   Submitted
    *   If you submit again, it will overwrite your previous submission and score.
    *   Save regularly. Your last saved submission will be evaluated.

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image depicts a user taking an online exam or coding challenge. The user has submitted a SQL query to filter data based on the "type" column, specifically looking for entries where the type is "Gold" (case-insensitive and ignoring leading/trailing spaces). The system has evaluated the query as correct and awarded a score of 10/10. The submission message indicates that the user has already submitted the answer and that submitting again will overwrite the previous submission.

**4. Technical Details (Code Snippet):**

The code snippet is a SQL query:

*   `FROM tickets`:  Specifies that the data is being retrieved from a table named "tickets".
*   `WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';`: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `type`: Refers to a column named "type" in the "tickets" table.
    *   `TRIM(type)`: Removes any leading or trailing spaces from the value in the "type" column.

**Image: TDS GA1**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) of what appears to be an online learning platform or course management system. It displays information related to a specific module and assignment within a course. The UI elements include:

*   **Navigation Menu:** A vertical menu on the left side with icons and labels for "Modules" and "Grades".
*   **Module Information:** A section displaying the module title and details about a graded assignment.
*   **Assignment Details:** Information about the assignment, including the due date, submission status, score, peer average, and median score.
*   **Header:** A header with the IIT Madras logo, course name ("Jan 2025-TDS"), and icons for notifications, messages, and user profile.

**2. Text Content:**

The visible text content includes:

*   "IIT Madras"
*   "Jan 2025-TDS" (likely a course code or name)
*   "Modules"
*   "Grades"
*   "Module 1: Development Tools"
*   "Graded Assignment 1"
*   "Assessment (Due: 26 Jan 2025)"
*   "Submitted"
*   "Your Score: 100 View Chart"
*   "Peer Average: 99% View Chart"
*   "Median Score: 100"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows a student's view of their progress in a course. It provides information about a specific module ("Development Tools") and a graded assignment within that module. The student can see their score, the peer average, and the median score, allowing them to compare their performance with others in the course. The "View Chart" links likely lead to visual representations of the score distribution.

**4. Technical Details:**

The image is a screenshot of a web-based UI. The layout suggests a responsive design, with a vertical navigation menu and a main content area. The use of icons and clear labels indicates a focus on usability. The "View Chart" links suggest the use of data visualization techniques to present performance data.

Thats not the dashboard.

We have checked your submissions. Unfortunately your last submission was 0 (on the 19th of Jan). Only the last submission is considered for evaluation not the previous ones.

@carlton Why is there a mismatch between the scores?

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a UI element, specifically a section listing "Recent saves." It appears to be a list of saved game states or configurations, possibly from a game or application. Each entry shows a "Reload" button/link, the date and time of the save, and a "Score" value. The entire section is contained within a light green rounded rectangle.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Title:** "Recent saves"
*   **Entries:** Each entry contains:
    *   "Reload" (likely a button or link)
    *   "from" (followed by a date and time)
    *   "Score:" (followed by a numerical score)

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The purpose of this UI element is to allow the user to quickly access and reload previously saved states. This is a common feature in games, applications, or any system where users might want to revert to a previous point in time.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The dates are formatted as "DD/MM/YYYY".
*   The times are formatted as "H:MM:SS am/pm".
*   The scores are numerical values with two decimal places.
*   The "Reload" elements are likely interactive buttons or links.
*   The UI is designed with a clean, simple aesthetic.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a UI element, likely from an online learning platform or course management system. It shows a course card or module preview.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **"Tools in Data Science"**: This is the title of the course or module.
*   **"REPEAT FULL COURSE"**: This suggests an option to retake the entire course.
*   **"Week 1 Assignment - 72.50"**: This indicates an assignment for the first week of the course, possibly with a score or grade of 72.50.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image likely represents a course offering or a student's progress within a course. The "REPEAT FULL COURSE" option suggests the student may have already completed the course or is given the option to restart. The "Week 1 Assignment" indicates progress within the course structure.

**4. Technical details:**

The background of the course card is a dark maroon color with a subtle pattern of small dots. The text is white. The UI element is likely part of a larger web application or platform.

Hi Yogesh,

There is no discrepancy, your last submission *before* the deadline was on 22nd Jan 8:14 pm. You scored 7.25, exactly as mentioned in your recent saves.

The higher score was on the 27th of Jan *after* the deadline.

Kind regards
