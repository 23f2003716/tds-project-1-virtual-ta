Dear Sir,

I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.

I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web page or application interface. It displays user login information, a logout button, and a list of recent saves with associated scores.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   "You are logged in as 23f3004246@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."
*   "Logout"
*   "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)"
*   "Reload from 3/2/2025, 1:44:11 PM. Score: 6"
*   "Reload from 3/2/2025, 1:41:44 PM. Score: 5"
*   "Reload from 3/2/2025, 1:38:33 PM. Score: 4"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The interface seems to be part of an online assessment or learning platform. The user is logged in, and the "Recent saves" section likely shows the history of their attempts or progress, with the most recent save representing their official score. The "Reload" buttons probably allow the user to revert to a previous save point.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The "Reload" elements are likely buttons or links.
*   The dates and times indicate when the saves were made.
*   The "Score" values suggest a scoring system is in place.
*   The email address "23f3004246@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" indicates that the user is associated with "ds.study.iitm.ac.in", which is likely a domain for data science studies at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).

Hi @carlton @Jivraj sir,

I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”

I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm?

Thank you

24F1001631 here. It is also showing absent for me. I had submitted before the time limit and also after the time limit after hacking it(wasn’t sure if it was allowed but decided to try it nevertheless)

I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the time limit.

My roll number is 24F1001631.

We have not yet updated the scores for ROE (there are roughly 130 students affected by the previous update). So just wait till it gets pushed by operations (most likely Tuesday). I can assure you that we have the right scores on our server, there is just an issue when “transporting” those scores over to the operations team, which we have now rectified and since scores are batch processed it will happen over night during a server update.

Bottom line: wait till Tuesday

Both bonus and your actual roe scores will reflect on dashboard by then.

If not let us know

Kind regards.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a course overview or dashboard, likely from an online learning platform. It displays information about a course titled "Tools in Data Science". It lists assignments and quizzes with their corresponding grades or status.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Title:** "Tools in Data Science"
*   **Subtitle:** "NEW COURSE"
*   **Assignments:**
    *   "Week 1 Assignment - 100.00"
    *   "Week 2 Assignment - 100.00"
    *   "Week 3 Assignment - 100.00"
    *   "Week 4 Assignment - 100.00"
    *   "Week 5 Assignment - 100.00"
*   **Quiz:** "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent"
*   **Button:** "Go to Course page >"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image provides a summary of a student's progress in the "Tools in Data Science" course. It shows that the student has received a perfect score (100.00) on all assignments for the first five weeks. However, the student is marked as "Absent" for "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1". The "Go to Course page" button likely directs the user to the main course page for more detailed information or to access course materials.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The UI elements suggest a web-based platform.
*   The consistent formatting of the assignment lines (e.g., "Week X Assignment - 100.00") indicates a structured data presentation.
*   The use of "Absent" suggests a binary status for the quiz (either completed or not).
*   The color scheme is predominantly white and brown. The background behind the title has a pattern of dots.

I was attend the roe. Why is it showing as absent?

Dear Sir,

I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE  multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.

I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue
