**Image: Screenshot 2025-01-12 223630**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a UI element, likely from a web application or development environment, related to GitHub Pages. It displays a question, a placeholder URL format, an input field, and an error message.

**2. Text content visible:**

*   **Question:** "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like:"
*   **Placeholder URL:** "https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/"
*   **Error Message:** "Error: 22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response:      Dolphin Facts  body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: #e0f7fa; color: #333; text-align:"

**3. Context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image appears to be part of a tool or interface that helps users understand or configure their GitHub Pages URL. The placeholder URL provides an example of the expected format. The error message indicates that a specific email address (22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was not found in the response from a server, and the response it received was the HTML code for a webpage titled "Dolphin Facts". This suggests that the tool is attempting to verify the GitHub Pages URL by checking if a particular email address is associated with the deployed content.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The placeholder URL "https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/" indicates the standard format for GitHub Pages URLs, where "[USER]" is the GitHub username and "[REPO]" is the repository name.
*   The error message includes HTML code, specifically the document type declaration (``), the `` tag with the language attribute set to "en", the `` section with meta tags for character set (UTF-8) and viewport configuration, and the `` tag with the content "Dolphin Facts". It also includes a `` tag with

i have included the email address still its giving error

**Image: Screenshot 2025-01-12 223956**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a UI element, specifically a text input field within a dark-themed interface. Above the input field is a question prompt, and below it is an error message.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Question:** "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api"
*   **Input Field Content:** "https://markdarshan.vercel.app/api"
*   **Error Message:** "TypeError: Failed to fetch"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image appears to be part of a setup or configuration process where the user is being asked to provide the URL of their Vercel deployment. The example URL provided suggests that the user needs to specify the base URL of their application, including the "/api" endpoint. The error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch" indicates that the application is unable to retrieve data from the provided URL, suggesting a problem with the URL itself, the server at that URL, or network connectivity.

**4. Technical details:**

The "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error is a common JavaScript error that occurs when the `fetch` API (used for making network requests) encounters a problem. This could be due to:

*   **Incorrect URL:** The URL provided might be misspelled or point to a non-existent endpoint.
*   **CORS Issue:** The server at the provided URL might not be configured to allow cross-origin requests from the client application.
*   **Network Problem:** There might be a network connectivity issue preventing the client from reaching the server.
*   **Server Error:** The server at the provided URL might be experiencing an error or be unavailable.

that website is working fine . just  write the parameters after /api

Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem.

Try adding CORS to your code it might work.

Kind regards

**2. Text Content:**

*   **`main.py` (Code Editor):**
    *   `from fastapi import FastAPI, Query`
    *   `from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware`
    *   `from typing import List, Optional`
    *   `import csv`
    *   `app = FastAPI()`
    *   `# Enable CORS`
    *   `app.add_middleware(...)` (CORS configuration)
    *   `# Load student data from the specified CSV file`
    *   Code to read a CSV file named `q-fastapi.csv` and load student data into a list called `students`.
    *   `@app.get("/api")`
    *   `async def get_students(class_: Optional[List[str]] = Query(None)):`
    *   Code to filter students based on the `class_` parameter.
    *   `if __name__ == "__main__":`
    *   `import uvicorn`
    *   `uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)`
*   **Terminal Window:**
    *   Output from running `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
    *   Indicates that Uvicorn is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
    *   Logs of HTTP requests:
        *   `OPTIONS /?class=1A&class=8A&class=BD&class=7N HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
        *   `GET /?class=1A&class=8A&class=8D&class=7N HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found`

@carlton can you please tell me what is wrong in this because I am getting “Error: Response undefined does not match expected” to my answer

Facing Issue in GA 2 Question 10 LLM ngrok

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays an error page, likely from a service like ngrok, indicating a problem with tunneling traffic to a local web service. The page includes UI elements like icons representing the connection path (Internet, ngrok Edge, ngrok Agent, Your Service) and a prominent error message box.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Top Section:**
    *   "Internet" (below a green phone icon)
    *   "ngrok Edge" (below a green globe icon)
    *   "ngrok Agent" (below a green command line icon)
    *   "Your Service" (below a grey server icon)

*   **Error Message Box:**
    *   "ERR\_NGROK\_8012" (Error title)
    *   "Traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, but the agent failed to establish a connection to the upstream web service at http://localhost:8080. The error encountered was:"
    *   "dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused" (Error details)
    *   "Get help with this error" (link)

*   **Developer Information:**
    *   "If you're the developer of this page"
    *   "On the machine where the ngrok agent is running, make sure a web service is running on http://localhost:8080. Try to cURL or open the address in a browser to see that you get the correct response."
    *   "Check out the docs to get help with this error." (link)

*   **Visitor Information:**
    *   "If you're a visitor of this page"
    *   "Wait a few minutes and refresh the page. If that still doesn't work, please contact the developer of this page for more information." (link)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The page is an error message displayed when ngrok (or a similar tunneling service) is unable to connect to the local web service it's supposed to be forwarding traffic to. It provides information about the error, potential causes, and troubleshooting steps for both developers and visitors.

**4. Technical Details:**

I tired multiple times but issue is still there.

@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Kindly help me out.

Hi Mishkat,

Please use  triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily.

eg

if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello")

Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.

Thanks and kind regards

Hi Mishkat,

This error is because you are filtering on `class_` instead of `class`

So if you send a request on `http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S` you will see response for that `1S` class only.

kind regards

Hi Guddu,

Inside `index.html` file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.

This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.

kind regards.

I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.

**Image: Docker Desktop Error**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows an error message dialog box from Docker Desktop. The dialog box is displayed on a dark blue background, typical of many application interfaces. The dialog box contains an error message, suggested solutions, a diagnostic log, and buttons to gather diagnostics and quit.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The text content in the image includes:

*   **Title:** "Docker Desktop - Unexpected WSL error"
*   **Error Message:** "An unexpected error occurred while executing a WSL command."
*   **Suggested Solutions:** "Either shut down WSL down with `wsl --shutdown`, and/or reboot your machine. You can also try reinstalling WSL and/or Docker Desktop. If the issue persists, collect diagnostics and submit an issue."
*   **Log Snippet:**
    *   "deploying WSL2 distributions"
    *   "ensuring main distro is deployed: deploying "docker-desktop": importing WSL distro "WSL2 is not supported with"
*   **Link:** "Read our policy for uploaded diagnostic data"
*   **Buttons:** "Gather diagnostics", "Quit"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image displays an error message from Docker Desktop, indicating a problem with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The error message suggests possible solutions, such as shutting down WSL, rebooting the machine, or reinstalling WSL and/or Docker Desktop. It also provides a link to collect diagnostics and submit an issue, as well as a link to read the policy for uploaded diagnostic data. The log snippet suggests that the error occurred during the deployment of WSL2 distributions, specifically when importing the "docker-desktop" distro.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The error message indicates a problem with WSL, which is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019.
*   The error message suggests that the issue might be related to the deployment of WSL2 distributions, which is the second version of WSL and offers improved performance.
*   The log snippet indicates that the error occurred when importing the "docker-desktop" distro, which is likely the distribution used by Docker Desktop to run containers.
*   The error message "WSL2 is not supported with

I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator).

wsl --version

WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
WSLg version: 1.0.65
MSRDC version: 1.2.5620
Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511
DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release
Windows version: 10.0.19045.5011

Tried many solutions after googling for the issue.

So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?

Hi Telvin,

Try opening `localhost:8080` in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.

I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.

kind regards

@Nelson I would recommend [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) rather than [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Docker Desktop is [not free for organizations over 250 people](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/) and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

@22f2001640 in that case

a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080

Please try one of these:

Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
GitHub codespaces, as @Jivraj suggested

You *could* try an ngrok alternative like [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) but I don’t think that’ll work.

Thank you, Sir!

What is the Docker image URL? It should look like: `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general`

If I use Podman, will the answer be correct assuming I have done all steps correctly?

    *   `Check`, `Save` (Buttons)
    *   Instructions on how the API should behave based on the `class` query parameter.
    *   `Ensure that you have CORS enabled. Otherwise, we can't send requests to your server.`
    *   `What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: http://127.

@carlton my answer got excepted before but now it is only working on the terminal after I modified the code but when I paste the url in the answer box it is again showing error

Hi Mishkat,

The GA url encoded parameter is `class`

In your screenshot, you are using `class_`

Your code that we examined earlier also accepts `class_` as the parameter instead of `class` as required by the GA

The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded parameter `class`

**Image: Screenshot 2025-01-14 at 8.54.07 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser page displaying an error message from ngrok.  The page indicates a problem with tunneling traffic to a local web service.  There's a visual representation of the connection flow, showing Internet -> ngrok Edge -> ngrok Agent -> Your Service, with a red "X" indicating a failure at the "Your Service" stage.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Page Title (Browser Tab):** "ERR_NGROK..." (likely truncated)
*   **URL:** "9eab-2402-e280-3e1e-19a-508b-9d2e-a63e-931c.ngrok-free.app"
*   **Error Message:**
    *   "ERR_NGROK_8012"
    *   "Traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, but the agent failed to establish a connection to the upstream web service at http://localhost:5000. The error encountered was:"
    *   "dial tcp [::1]:5000: connect: connection refused"
    *   "Get help with this error" (hyperlink)
*   **Developer Information:**

Hi Mishkat,

In your code, the word `class` is a reserved keyword in python. So simply changing `class_` to `class` is not going to work. The *only* thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api *not* the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem.

Kind regards

Hi Team ,

For GA - 2 , Question 6:

I am done with the code, deployed same on vercel.

And It is working fine gives correct json response as expected in browser.

But When I try to that on portal It gives me “CORS Missing Allow Origin” Error.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 6.58.43 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a combination of instructions, code snippets, and a browser's developer tools (specifically the "Network" tab). It appears to be part of a tutorial or assignment related to deploying a Python application to Vercel and creating an API.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Instructions:**
    *   "Download this q-vercel-python.json which has the marks of 100 imaginary students."
    *   "Create and deploy a Python app to Vercel. Expose an API so that when a request like https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y is made, it returns a JSON response with the marks of the names X and Y like this:"
    *   "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api"
    *   "Create a GitHub Action (1.5 marks)"
*   **Code Snippet:**
    *   `{ "marks": [10, 20] }`
*   **Vercel URL (with error):**
    *   `https://shagra-barodekars-projects.vercel.app/api`
    *   `TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.`
*   **Browser Developer Tools:**
    *   "Inspector", "Console", "Debugger", "Network", "Style Editor", "Performance", "Memory", "Storage", "Accessibility", "Application"
    *   "Filter URLs"
    *   "Status", "Method", "Domain", "File", "Initiator", "Type", "Transferred", "Size", "Headers", "Cookies", "Request", "Response", "Timings", "Stack Trace", "Security"
    *   "All", "HTML", "CSS", "JS", "XHR", "Fonts", "Images", "Media", "WS", "Other"
    *   "Disable Cache", "No Throttling"
    *   "Block", "Resend"
    *   "GET https://shagra-barodekars-projects.vercel.app/api?name=QtCN&name=8UD&name=

I have added “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” as “*” for allowing request from any origin.

I get the correct response in browser but it fails in quiz portal.

Can anyone please suggest what exactly I am missing here.

Thanks

Kushagra

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) element, specifically a form field or input box, along with some explanatory text and an error message. The input box is highlighted with a red border, indicating an issue. There's also a small red icon with an exclamation mark inside a circle, further suggesting an error or warning.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **"What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api"**: This is the prompt or question being asked, providing an example of the expected URL format.
*   **"https://your-app2.vercel.app/api"**: This is the URL entered by the user in the input box.
*   **"TypeError: Failed to fetch"**: This is an error message displayed below the input box, indicating a problem with fetching data from the provided URL.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image likely comes from a configuration or setup screen where the user is required to provide the URL of a Vercel-deployed application's API endpoint. The red highlighting, error icon, and error message suggest that the provided URL is either incorrect or unreachable, causing a "Failed to fetch" error.

**4. Technical details (based on the code screenshot):**

*   The error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch" is a common JavaScript error that occurs when the `fetch` API (used for making network requests) fails to retrieve data from the specified URL. This could be due to several reasons:
    *   The URL is incorrect or doesn't exist.
    *   The server at the URL is down or unreachable.
    *   There's a network connectivity issue.
    *   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions are preventing the request.
    *   The server is not responding with a valid HTTP response.
*   The example URL "https://your-app.vercel.app/api" suggests that the application is deployed on Vercel, a popular platform for hosting web applications.
*   The user-entered URL "https://your-app2.vercel.app/api" is similar to the example, but with "app2" instead

Hello, this is working when I put in parameters, but not when I submit on quiz portal. What to do?

Hi Aindree,

I tried to send a request to your application `https://your-app2.vercel.app/api` with url encoded parameter `class=7Q`. It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends `{"marks": []}`.

Check if your csv file is correct.  Also check if code is correct.

Kind regards

For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue

Hi Tushar,

For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running.

For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission.

Kind regards

For the Q.2 on image compression, for PNG, SVG or WEBP files, I’m getting the error “Could not process image. Is it browser supported image? Image pixels do not match the original” (I believe the last part is not applicable as the image was not processed ). Visually, I could not find any difference between the two files and the size of new file is less than 1,500 bytes.

Tried through Chrome v132.0.6834.83 without any add-ons/extensions.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a UI element for uploading a file, specifically an image. It also displays an error message related to the image upload.

**2. Text Content:**

*   "Upload your losslessly compressed image (less than 1,500 bytes)"
*   "Choose File"
*   "shapes\_compressed.png"
*   "Error: Could not process image. Is it a browser-supported image? Image pixels do not match the original"

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The image depicts a scenario where a user is attempting to upload an image to a system. The system has specific requirements for the image: it must be losslessly compressed and smaller than 1,500 bytes. The error message indicates that the uploaded image, "shapes\_compressed.png", failed to meet the system's criteria. The error suggests two possible reasons: the image format might not be supported by the browser, or the image pixels have been altered from the original.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The UI element includes a "Choose File" button, which is a standard HTML form element for file selection.
*   The text "shapes\_compressed.png" likely represents the name of the file that the user selected for upload.
*   The error message suggests that the system is performing some kind of validation on the uploaded image, possibly checking its format and pixel data against an expected original. The pixel check implies that the system might be expecting a specific image or a version of an image with particular pixel values.
*   The size restriction (less than 1,500 bytes) indicates that the system is concerned about storage space or bandwidth usage.
*   The requirement for lossless compression suggests that the system needs to preserve the original image data without any loss of quality.

i am getting this error

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) element, likely from a web application or development environment. It presents instructions and information related to deploying a Python application to Vercel. There's a link to download a JSON file, instructions on creating and deploying a Python app, an example of a JSON response, a prompt for a Vercel URL, and an error message.

**2. Text content visible:**

*   "Download this q-vercel-python.json which has the marks of 100 imaginary students."
*   "Create and deploy a Python app to Vercel. Expose an API so that when a request like https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y is made, it returns a JSON response with the marks of the names X and Y like this:"

*   "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api"
*   "https://student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api"
*   "TypeError: Failed to fetch"

**3. Context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image appears to be part of a tutorial or guide on how to create and deploy a Python application to Vercel, specifically one that exposes an API to retrieve student marks. The user is being instructed to download a JSON file containing student data, deploy a Python app to Vercel, and expose an API endpoint. The example JSON shows the expected format of the API response. The user has entered a Vercel URL, but an error "TypeError: Failed to fetch" is displayed, indicating a problem with retrieving data from the provided URL.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **JSON Example:** The JSON example `{"marks": [10, 20]}` shows a simple JSON object with a key "marks" and a value that is an array containing the numbers 10 and 20. This likely represents the marks of two students.
*   **Vercel URL:** The provided Vercel URL `

i have tried to submit it will a query as well but than also it is giving me the same error.But for me it is giving me the correct output.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. UI Elements:**

*   **Browser Interface:** The image shows a portion of a web browser window. We can see the back, forward, and refresh buttons, as well as the address bar.
*   **Address Bar:** The address bar contains a URL.
*   **"Pretty-print" Checkbox:** There's a "Pretty-print" label with a checked checkbox next to it. This suggests the content is being displayed in a formatted, readable way.
*   **JSON Output:** The main content area displays JSON data.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **URL:** `student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api?name=IjJOGavw&name=Ry2N2zqyxV`
*   **"Pretty-print"**
*   **JSON Data:**
    ```json
    {
      "marks": [65, 74]
    }
    ```

**3. Context/Purpose:**

*   **API Endpoint:** The URL suggests that the browser is accessing an API endpoint related to student marks. The `vercel.app` domain indicates it's likely hosted on Vercel.
*   **Query Parameters:** The URL includes query parameters `name=IjJOGavw&name=Ry2N2zqyxV`. This suggests that the API is expecting a "name" parameter, and it's being passed twice with different values.
*   **JSON Response:** The JSON data represents the response from the API. It contains a single key, "marks", which is associated with an array of two numbers: 65 and 74. These likely represent the marks of a student.
*   **Pretty-printing:** The "Pretty-print" checkbox suggests that the JSON data is being displayed in a human-readable format, with indentation and formatting to make it easier to understand.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **JSON Format:** The data is in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, a standard format for data interchange on the web.
*   **API Interaction:** The image shows the result of a GET request to an API endpoint. The API likely retrieves student marks based on the provided name(

@Jivraj  @carlton

i have added the header key in order to use the cors as said in the vercel doc but still i am getting that error.

what to do?

i have added the cors in the app.py file as well

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

# Load the data
with open("q-vercel-python.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

@app.route("/api", methods=["GET"])
def get_marks():
    names = request.args.getlist("name")
    marks = [student["marks"] for student in data if student["name"] in names]
    return jsonify({"marks": marks})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

@23f2003751

While I understand why you might choose to use `flask` due to your familiarity with it,

the `http.server` library is just very simple to use.

The **only extra line of code** you would need inside your `get` request if you used the `http.server` library would be:

`self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")`

Try to rewrite your code using `http.server`  library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy.

The boilerplate code for a `get` request using the `http.server` library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm.

Kind regards

@23F300327 You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.

GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.

Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.

Also the live sessions on [youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C&si=NE4LEQe48XfzAYbc) will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.

There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.

The image shows a web browser window. The main content area displays a JSON object. The browser's address bar is visible, along with several tabs.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Address Bar:** `https://vercel-fastapi-aa0kdktjz-mishkat02s-projects.vercel.app/api?name=IE&name=G6k`
*   **Content Area:**
    *   `Pretty print`
    *   `{"marks": [50,53]}`
*   **Tab Titles:**
    *   `Project 1 ::`
    *   `TDS 2025 J`
    *   `GA2 - Deplo`
    *   `how to insta`
    *   `(no subject)`
    *   `ChatGPT`
    *   `vercel-fasta` (appears three times)
*   **Other UI elements:**
    *   Back/Forward buttons
    *   Refresh button
    *   Star icon (bookmark)
    *   Download icon
    *   Menu icon
    *   "All Bookmarks"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows the output of a web API endpoint. The URL suggests the API is built using FastAPI and deployed on Vercel. The API endpoint seems to be returning a JSON object containing a list of "marks" (likely scores or grades), which are the numbers 50 and 53. The `name` parameter in the URL is being passed twice with different values (`IE` and `G6k`), which might be relevant to how the API functions.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **JSON:** The data is formatted as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object. This is a common format for data exchange between web servers and clients.
*   **API Endpoint:** The URL points to an API endpoint, which is a specific address on a web server that provides data or functionality.
*   **Query Parameters:** The `?name=IE&name=G6k` part of the URL represents query parameters. These are used to pass data to the API endpoint. In this case, the `name`

when I paste the url it is showing TypeError: Failed to fetch

my code:

import json
import pandas as pd
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
try:
    data = pd.read_csv('marks.csv')

    data = None

            self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"error": "marks.csv not found"}).encode())
            return

        parsed_path = urlparse(self.path)
        query_params = parse_qs(parsed_path.query)
        names = query_params.get('name', [])  # Get list of names from query parameters

        marks = [
            int(data[data['name'] == name]['marks'].values[0]) if not data[data['name'] == name].empty else None 
            for name in names
        ]

        response = json.dumps({"marks": marks})
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header("Content-type", "application/json")
        self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")  # Enable CORS
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(response.encode())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server_address = ('', 8000)  # Run on port 8000
    httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, MarksHandler)
    print("Server running on port 8000...")
    httpd.serve_forever()

@23F300327

Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.

When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api

with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.

The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.

That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this

# api/index.py
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
        self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
        return

Notice there is no `if __name__ == "__main__":` code block.

This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.

`if __name__ == "__main__":` is used to execute some code **only** if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.

Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default `handler` class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.

Another possible problem:

By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues [TDS > Development Tools > unicode](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/unicode)

So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.

Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.

Kind regards

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. UI Elements:**

*   **Text Input Field:** There's a text input field, likely for entering a URL. It has a red border, suggesting an error or validation issue.
*   **Text Labels/Prompts:** There are text prompts guiding the user.
*   **Error Message:** An error message is displayed below the input field.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Prompt:** "What is your repository URL? It will look like: https://github.com/USER/REPO"
*   **Input Field Content:** "https://github.com/NAMAN-BERI/actions.git"
*   **Error Message:** "Error: No runs found"

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The image appears to be from a user interface where a user is being asked to provide the URL of their GitHub repository. The prompt gives an example of the expected format. The user has entered a URL, but an error message "Error: No runs found" is displayed. This suggests that the system is unable to find any workflow runs associated with the provided repository URL.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The URL in the input field follows the standard GitHub repository URL format: `https://github.com//.git`. In this case, the username is "NAMAN-BERI" and the repository name is "actions".
*   The error message "No runs found" indicates that the system is likely trying to access or retrieve information about workflow runs (likely GitHub Actions) for the specified repository, but it's unable to find any. This could be due to several reasons:
    *   No GitHub Actions workflows have been configured for the repository.
    *   The user might not have the necessary permissions to view the workflow runs.
    *   There might be an issue with the system's ability to access the GitHub repository.
    *   The repository might not exist.

even though its their

i don’t know why i am facing this issue anyone please check my git

how to create a iitm account in github…i am not getting the username

please guide

its proceeding like this …for my user name

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. UI Elements:**

*   **Password Field:** A text input field labeled "Password" with an asterisk indicating it's a required field. The field contains a series of dots, representing a masked password. The input field has a green border, indicating that the password meets the requirements.
*   **Password Requirements:** Text below the password field specifies the password requirements: "Password should be at least 15 characters OR at least 8 characters including a number and a lowercase letter."
*   **Username Field:** A text input field labeled "Username" with an asterisk indicating it's a required field. The field contains the text "navya". The input field has a blue border, indicating that the username is not available.
*   **Username Availability Message:** A message in red text below the username field indicates that the username "navya" is not available.
*   **Suggested Usernames:** A list of suggested usernames in red text: "navya-stack, navya-cmyk, or navya856 are available."

**2. Text Content:**

*   "Password\*"
*   "..." (masked password)
*   "Password should be at least 15 characters OR at least 8 characters including a number and a lowercase letter."
*   "Username\*"
*   "navya"
*   "Username navya is not available."
*   "navya-stack, navya-cmyk, or navya856 are available."

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The image shows a registration or account creation form. The user is in the process of entering a password and username. The system is validating the input and providing feedback. The password field is valid, but the username "navya" is already taken, so the system suggests alternative usernames.

**4. Technical Details:**

This is a UI screenshot, likely from a web application or mobile app. The use of asterisks, input fields, and validation messages are standard UI patterns for forms. The color-coding (green for valid, red for invalid) is a common way to provide visual feedback to the user.

Hi Mishkat,

I think url that you are submitting is wrong one. In below image there are two url’s under Domains those would be correct url’s to be submitted.

For example `https://tds21jan.vercel.app/`.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) from a web application, likely a deployment platform like Vercel. It displays information about a specific deployment, including its status, domains, and source.  There's also an error message displayed.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Error Message:**
    *   `404: NOT_FOUND`
    *   `Code: 'NOT_FOUND'`
    *   `ID: 'sfol::xj47q-1737473362971-adc9c00e6fa8'`
    *   `Read our documentation to learn more about this error.`
*   **Deployment Information:**
    *   `Deployment`
    *   `tds21jan-ghtj3xr7w-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app`
    *   `Domains`
    *   `tds21jan.vercel.app` (with an external link icon)
    *   `tds21jan-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app` (with an external link icon)
    *   `+1` (likely indicating more domains)
    *   `Status`
    *   `Ready` (with a green circle indicator)
    *   `Created`
    *   `18h ago by jivraj-18`
    *   `Source`
    *   `<> View code`
    *   `>_ vercel deploy`
*   **Call to Action:**
    *   `Connect your Project with a Git repository to create a Production Deployment.`
    *   `Connect Git re` (likely a button to connect to a Git repository)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The UI is likely part of a deployment management dashboard. It provides an overview of a specific deployment, its status, and related information. The error message suggests that a resource was not found during the deployment or when accessing the deployed application. The "Connect your Project" message indicates that the user hasn't yet linked their project to a Git repository for automated deployments.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The deployment URL (`tds

I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a `vercel.json` configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code.

You can follow [Gui Bibeau’s guide](https://www.frontend-devops.com/blog/python-on-vercel) to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM.

For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to [this guide on DEV Community](https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/how-to-deploy-a-python-flask-app-to-vercel-2o5k). I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.

From image that you have shared, it explains ngrok tunnel that you are submitting in answer is not running.

For any assignment if it involves running some server then you would need to keep all the server’s running when you submit

Hi Naman,

error code 524 is generally because of timeout in response, one thing you can check is if there is load on Llama server as information that I got by a google search [Error 524: A Timeout Occurred (What It Is & How to Fix It)](https://www.lifewire.com/error-524-a-timeout-occurred-4782741). I tried submitting now while replying at 2:45 am it was working fine.

@s.anand Is there any problem from our end, such as tds hosting server receiving lots of traffic on website.

Hi Srividhya,

This error is because you are trying to access a feature of ngrok which requires to pay [ERR_NGROK_501 | ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/errors/err_ngrok_501/#:~:text=Only%20Personal%2C%20Pro%2C%20Enterprise%2C%20or%20Pay-as-you-go%20accounts%20can,resolving%20this%20error%2C%20please%20reach%20out%20to%20support%40ngrok.com).

I think you didn’t use authtoken to authenticate through your laptop. Follow second step on this page [Quickstart | ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/) to authenticate.

Hi Irina,

This issue is because localhost is not there is no server available to listen on localhost.You are running ngrok in codespace but Llama server in local machine. run both of them in same machine either codespace or local machine.

Here is reference of error [ERR_NGROK_8012 | ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/errors/err_ngrok_8012/)

Regarding question no. 9 Web Framework: FastAPI. I got the following error for the answer to the question

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screen capture of what appears to be documentation or instructions related to testing a FastAPI API. It includes text, an example API URL, and an error message. The bottom of the screen shows the Windows taskbar.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   "If the URL has a query parameter `class`, it should return only students in those classes. For example, `/api?class=1A` should return only students in class 1A. `/api?class=1A&class=18` should return only students in class 1A and 18. There may be any number of classes specified. Return students in the same order as they appear in the CSV file (not the order of the classes)."
*   "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin."
*   "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`"
*   `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` (This is displayed as a clickable link)
*   "Error: Response undefined does not match expected [["studentid":67,"class":"6X"],["studentid":86,"class":"ST"],["studentid":91,"class":"ST"],["studentid":187,"class":"78"], ["studentid":217,"class":"6X"],["studentid":221,"class":"ST"], ["studentid":408,"class":"6X"], ["studentid":471,"class":"22"], ["studentid":708,"class":"6X"], ["studentid":734,"class":"ST"], ["studentid":735,"class":"22"],["studentId":928,"class":"78"],["studentid":1007,"class":"ST"],["studentid":1029,"class":"ST"],["studentid":1090,"class":"78"], ["studentid":1106,"class":"22"], ["studentid":1154,"class":"6X"],["studentid":1313,"class":"6X"],["studentid":1354

But when I run the url in my browser  I got the following response

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser window displaying JSON data. The data appears to be a list of student records.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **URL:** `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=6X&class=5T&class=78&class=2Z`
*   **JSON Data:** The main content is a JSON array of objects. Each object represents a student and has two key-value pairs:
    *   `"studentId"`: An integer representing the student's ID.
    *   `"class"`: A string representing the student's class (e.g., "6X", "5T", "78", "2Z").
    *   Examples of student records:
        *   `{"studentId":67,"class":"6X"}`
        *   `{"studentId":86, "class":"5T"}`
        *   `{"studentId":187,"class":"78"}`
        *   `{"studentId":471, "class":"2Z"}`
*   **Other UI Text:**
    *   "Pretty-print" (likely a browser extension or feature to format JSON)
    *   "ENG" (likely indicating the language setting)
    *   "06:55" (time)
    *   "24-01-2025" (date)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows the response from an API endpoint. The API seems to be designed to retrieve student data, and the URL suggests that it's filtering students based on their class. The `class` parameter is repeated multiple times in the URL, which might indicate that the API is designed to return students belonging to any of the specified classes.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

*   **JSON:** The data is formatted in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a standard format for data interchange.
*   **API Endpoint:** The URL `127.0.0.1:8000/api` indicates a local development server

I have checked both the expected result from the assignment and result from direct running of url both are same. I don’t find any difference.

@carlton  can you clarify where went wrong

@Jivraj  Hello Sir, I’m also using Squoosh. The pixel size of the resulting image is 800 x 600 and the file size is 1,473 bytes. The steps I used to create the solution image:

Open Squoosh and load the image
In the dropdown in “Compress” section, select “OxiPNG”. Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2).
The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) for an image editing or optimization tool. It appears to be a section within a larger application, focusing on image compression settings. The UI elements include:

*   **Sections:** "Edit" and "Compress" are section headers, likely indicating different categories of image manipulation options.
*   **Toggles:** "Resize" and "Reduce palette" have toggle switches (currently in the "off" position).
*   **Dropdown Menu:** A dropdown menu labeled "OxiPNG" is visible, suggesting options for different compression algorithms or settings.
*   **Checkbox:** A checkbox labeled "Interlace" is present, but it is unchecked.
*   **Slider:** A slider labeled "Effort:" is set to a value of "2".
*   **Compression Result:** A visual indicator shows a "63%" reduction, resulting in a file size of "1.41 kB".
*   **Download Button:** A prominent blue button with a download icon is visible.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   Edit
*   Resize
*   Reduce palette
*   Compress
*   OxiPNG
*   Interlace
*   Effort:
*   63%
*   1.41 kB

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The UI is designed to allow users to adjust image compression settings to reduce file size. The user can choose to resize the image, reduce the color palette, select a compression algorithm (OxiPNG is currently selected), enable interlacing, and adjust the compression effort. The UI provides feedback on the resulting file size reduction. The download button allows the user to save the optimized image.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

While not a code screenshot or technical diagram, the UI suggests the following technical aspects:

*   **Image Compression Algorithms:** The "OxiPNG" dropdown implies the use of different PNG compression algorithms.
*   **Interlacing:** The "Interlace" option refers to a technique for progressively displaying an image as it downloads.
*   **Compression Effort:** The "Effort" slider likely controls the level of compression applied, with higher effort potentially resulting in smaller file sizes but longer

I also tried WebP with “Lossless” option selected and “Effort” increased to 9. This gives even smaller filesize at just 630 bytes. However, even that image is not accepted. The selected options for WebP are in the screenshot below.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) for an image editing or compression tool. It appears to be a settings panel or dialog box. The UI elements include:

*   **Title Bar:** "Edit"
*   **Toggle Switches:** For "Resize" and "Reduce palette"
*   **Dropdown Menu:** For selecting a compression format (currently "WebP")
*   **Checkboxes:** For "Lossless", "Discrete tone image", and "Preserve transparent data"
*   **Sliders:** For "Effort" and "Slight loss"
*   **Download Button:** A circular blue button with a download icon.
*   **Compression Statistics:** Displaying a percentage reduction and file size.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Title:** "Edit"
*   **Options:** "Resize", "Reduce palette", "Compress", "WebP", "Lossless", "Effort:", "Slight loss:", "Discrete tone image", "Preserve transparent data"
*   **Values:** "9" (for Effort), "0" (for Slight loss), "83%" (compression percentage), "630 B" (file size)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The UI is designed to allow users to adjust image compression settings. The user can choose to resize the image, reduce the color palette, and select a compression format (WebP in this case). They can also control the level of compression, choosing between lossless and lossy compression, and adjusting parameters like "Effort" and "Slight loss" to fine-tune the compression process. The compression statistics provide feedback on the resulting file size reduction. The download button allows the user to save the compressed image.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **Compression Format:** The UI specifically supports WebP compression, a modern image format developed by Google.
*   **Compression Parameters:** The "Effort" slider likely controls the amount of processing time spent on compression, with higher values potentially resulting in better compression ratios. The "Slight loss" slider probably controls the level of acceptable visual degradation in exchange for smaller file sizes.
*   **Lossless vs. Lossy:** The "Lossless" checkbox indicates whether the compression should preserve all original image data (lossless) or

Contineously showing this sir. Even the server is running on background

**Image: Screenshot 2025-01-25 191736**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) element, likely from a web application or a desktop application. It appears to be a configuration or setup screen related to running a Llamafile model. The UI includes text instructions, an input field for a URL, an error message, and buttons.

**2. Text Content:**

*   "Download Llamafile. Run the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6\_K.llamafile model with it."
*   "Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok."
*   "What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://\[random].ngrok-free.app/"
*   "https://328e-43-251-171-164.ngrok-free.app/" (This is in an input field)
*   "Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524"
*   "Check" (Button)
*   "Save" (Button)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The UI is guiding the user to set up a Llamafile model, which is likely a large language model (LLM) packaged as a single executable file. The user needs to create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok, a tool that exposes local servers to the internet. The UI is asking for the ngrok URL, which is the public address that allows access to the Llamafile server. The error message indicates that the provided ngrok URL is not returning a valid JSON response, suggesting a problem with the server or the URL itself.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **Llamafile:** This refers to a specific way of packaging and running LLMs.
*   **Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6\_K.llamafile:** This is the name of the specific Llamafile model being used. It likely indicates a Llama 3 model with 2.1 billion parameters, an instruction-tuned version, and a Q6\_K quantization (a method to reduce the model size and memory usage).
*   **ngrok:** A reverse proxy tool used to create secure tunnels from a local machine to the public

for the fast api question, would there be an issue if i am using code spaces my url would  look like

[https://symmetrical-space-cod-wrrjw5rw6xv7hvj9p-8000.app.github.dev/api](https://symmetrical-space-cod-wrrjw5rw6xv7hvj9p-8000.app.github.dev/api)

Error is

TypeError: Failed to fetch

**Image: Screenshot 2025-01-26 184204**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. Content Overview:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of instructions or a task description related to building a FastAPI application. It outlines the expected behavior of an API endpoint that filters students based on class. It also shows an error message related to fetching data from the API.

**2. Text Content:**

*   "If the URL has a query parameter `class`, it should return only students in those classes. For example, `/api?class=1A` should return only students in class 1A. `/api?class=1A&class=1B` should return only students in class 1A and 1B. There may be any number of classes specified. Return students in the same order as they appear in the CSV file (not the order of the classes)."
*   "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin."
*   "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`"
*   "h" (partially visible, likely the start of a URL)
*   "TypeError: Failed to fetch"
*   "We'll check by sending a request to this URL with `?class=...` added and check if the response matches the data."

**3. UI Elements:**

*   There's a text input field (highlighted with a red border) where the user is likely expected to enter the API URL. The "h" suggests the user has started typing the URL.
*   An error icon (exclamation mark in a circle) is present within the text input field, indicating an issue.

**4. Context and Purpose:**

The image describes a task where the user needs to create a FastAPI API endpoint that can filter students by class based on a query parameter. The instructions specify how the filtering should work (multiple classes, order of students). The CORS requirement suggests the API will be accessed from a different origin (e.g., a web browser). The "TypeError: Failed to fetch" indicates that the provided API URL is not working or is inaccessible, preventing the system from fetching data from it.

**5. Technical Details:**

*   **API Endpoint:** The instructions describe an API endpoint that accepts a `class` query parameter

I’m leaving the url running, you can see you get a dummy response(clicking the link), how should i go about it. I’d prefer to use codespaces. Please help me

No problems, I got it , SOLUTION just made the port public

for the tunneling, i am currently unable to do it has the ports are mismatched, I’m still working on the issue, but using codespaces and public ports i’ve achieved similar results and the question is marked right. Is this wrong/unethical. I will try to tunnel using ngrok though

**Image: Screenshot 2025-01-26 204950**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a snippet of a user interface, likely from a tutorial or interactive learning environment. It presents instructions and a question related to setting up and accessing a Llamafile server using ngrok. There's a text input field (blurred out) where the user is expected to provide an answer.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   "Download Llamafile. Run the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6 K.llamafile model with it."
*   "Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok."
*   "What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://\[random].ngrok-free.app/"
*   "Correct"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The context is a tutorial or exercise guiding the user through the process of setting up and accessing a Llamafile server. The user is instructed to download Llamafile, run a specific model, create a tunnel using ngrok, and then provide the ngrok URL. The "Correct" text indicates that the user has successfully provided the correct ngrok URL in the blurred input field.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **Llamafile:** This refers to a specific type of file or software related to running large language models (LLMs).
*   **Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6 K.llamafile:** This is the name of a specific Llamafile model. The "Q6" likely refers to a quantization level, indicating the model's size and performance characteristics.
*   **ngrok:** This is a tool used to create secure tunnels to expose local servers to the internet. It's commonly used for development and testing purposes.
*   **ngrok URL:** This is the URL generated by ngrok when a tunnel is created. It allows external access to the local server. The example URL "https://\[random].ngrok-free.app/" shows the typical structure of an ngrok URL, where "[random]" is a randomly generated string.

@23f1002382

Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.

Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!

So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.

In the meanwhile:

There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.

Kind regards

Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again.

Can you clarify why this is happening?

because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong.

Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit.

The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks.

Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.”

Kind regards

hi @23f2003853

I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify  ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of `127.0.0.1`. Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.

Hello Sir,

I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue. Please shed some light on the same.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface element, likely from a web application or development environment. It includes text prompts, an input field, and an error message.

**2. Text Content:**

*   "Make sure you enable **CORS** to allow GET requests from any origin." (CORS is bolded)
*   "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api"
*   Input field containing: "https://new1-ivory.vercel.app/api"
*   "Error: Expected \[73,73,53,63,61] but got \[73,53,61,63,73]"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image suggests a user is configuring or testing an application deployed on Vercel. The system is prompting the user to provide the correct Vercel URL for their application. The error message indicates a validation failure, likely comparing the user-provided URL against an expected value or format. The CORS message indicates that the user needs to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to allow GET requests from any origin.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The error message "Expected \[73,73,53,63,61] but got \[73,53,61,63,73]" suggests that the system is performing some kind of character code or byte-level comparison of the URL. The numbers likely represent ASCII or Unicode values of characters. The error indicates that the order of some characters is incorrect.
*   The reference to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) indicates that the application is likely making requests to the Vercel URL from a different domain. CORS is a security mechanism that browsers use to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one which served the web page.
*   The URL format "https://your-app.vercel.app/api" suggests that the application has an API endpoint hosted on Vercel.
*   The URL "https://new1-ivory.vercel.app/api" is the user's attempt to provide the correct URL.

In summary, the image shows a user encountering an error while configuring

Thanks and Regards

Shalini

Hi Shalini,

I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend.

Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel,  just check your code if it’s logically correct.

Kind regards

The code contains the following text:

*   **Imports:** `import json`, `import os`, `from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler`, `from urllib.parse import parse_qs, urlparse`
*   **Class Definition:** `class handler (BaseHTTPRequestHandler):`
*   **`do_GET` function:**
    *   `def do_GET(self):`
    *   `# Set CORS headers to allow requests from any origin`
    *   `self.send_response(200)`
    *   `self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')`
    *   `self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, OPTIONS')`
    *   `self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type')`
    *   `self.send_header('Content-type', 'application/json')`
    *   `# Load the JSON data`
    *   `dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))`
    *   `json_file_path = os.path.join(dir_path, "../q-vercel-python.json")`
    *   `with open(json_file_path, "r") as file:`
    *   `data = json.load(file)`
    *   `# Parse query parameters`
    *   `query_components = parse_qs(urlparse(self.path).query)`
    *   `names = query_components.get('name', [])`
    *   `if not names:`
    *   `self.end_headers()`
    *   `self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"error": "Please provide a 'name' query parameter"}).encode('utf-8'))`

Here is my code. Could you please help me identify any issues or clarify where I might be going wrong?

    *   A disclaimer states: "ngrok staff will never ask you to enter a code on this page."
*   **Error Message:**
    *   The error message title is "Error".
    *   The error message text is: "The information supplied for MFA verification was invalid."
*   **Footer:** "Made with ❤️ by ngrok"
*   **Windows Activation:** "Activate Windows. Go to Settings to activate Windows. Privacy Preferences"
*   **Taskbar:** "Nifty midcap +1.74%" and the current time "13:31 29/01/2025"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image depicts a user attempting to set up MFA for their ngrok account. The "Device Activation" section suggests the user is being prompted to enter a code generated by an authenticator app on their device. The error message indicates that the code entered was incorrect or invalid. The disclaimer suggests that the user should be wary of entering codes on this page if they were not

can anyone guide me to fix it

Sir I am getting this “TypeError: Load failed” for Q9 inspite of getting proper responses in “[http://127.0.0.1:8000/api](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api)”, cors is also enabled. Please help me with this, I am finding it difficult to circumvent this.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 10.08.58 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a UI element, likely from a web application or development tool, related to configuring or testing an API endpoint. It includes text prompts, an input field, and an error message.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin."
*   "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api"
*   "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api" (This appears in an input field)
*   "TypeError: Load failed"
*   "We'll check by sending a request to this URL with ?class=... added and check if the response matches the data."

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The UI is designed to help a user configure or test a FastAPI API endpoint. The user is prompted to enter the API URL. The system then attempts to load or connect to the provided URL. The "TypeError: Load failed" message indicates that the system was unable to connect to the specified API endpoint. The text about CORS suggests that Cross-Origin Resource Sharing might be an issue preventing the connection. The final sentence indicates that the system will attempt to send a request to the URL with a query parameter and validate the response.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The API URL provided is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. This indicates that the API is expected to be running locally on port 8000.
*   The "TypeError: Load failed" suggests a client-side error, possibly in JavaScript, when trying to fetch data from the API. This could be due to network issues, CORS restrictions, or an invalid URL.
*   The mention of CORS indicates that the application making the request is likely running on a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) than the API.
*   The system is designed to automatically test the API by sending a request with a query parameter "?class=..." and validating the response. This suggests that the system is trying to determine the API's capabilities or data structure.

**Image: 2**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a web browser window. The window displays JSON code. The top of the window shows typical browser UI elements.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Browser UI:**
    *   The standard close, minimize, and maximize buttons (represented by colored circles).
    *   Navigation buttons (back and forward arrows).
    *   A Google logo.
    *   A tab with the address "127.0.0.1" (likely a local server).
    *   Other tabs labeled "Tools in Data Sc..." and "TDS 2025 Jan G..."
*   **JSON Code:**
    *   `{"students":[{"studentId":34,"class":"1A"},{"studentId":453,"class":"1A"},{"studentId":551,"class":"1A"},{"studentId":829,"class":"1A"},{"stude`
    *   `{"studentId":1309,"class":"1A"},{"studentId":1795,"class":"1A"}]}`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image likely shows a developer or someone working with data inspecting a JSON response from a local server (127.0.0.1). The JSON data represents a list of students, each with a `studentId` and a `class` attribute. All students in the visible data are in class "1A".

**4. Technical details (code screenshot):**

*   **JSON Structure:** The JSON is a dictionary (object) with a single key "students". The value associated with "students" is an array (list) of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the array represents a student and has two keys: "studentId" (an integer) and "class" (a string).
*   **Data:** The data seems to be a simplified representation of student records. The "class" field is consistently "1A" for all students shown.
*   **Potential Issues:** The JSON is cut off at the end of the first line, with "stude" being incomplete. This might indicate that the full JSON data is longer than what's visible in the screenshot.

I think in Q.6 its some error in your code’s logic its unable to fetch the data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the browser.

In Q9. I have created dictionary of given data. You can check the for format in the given codes just above the question.(see Test with curl api)

I think your code logic seem to be correct but it may be because u have downloaded twice the same image and in your output lenna.webp is saving to lenna(1).webp.

Try to do it again after deleting those images which are already downloaded!

Hi @24ds1000082_Vivek ,

I don’t see any difference between them. Can you share screen shot of browser console tab and Network tab. Also join tomorrow’s session towards ending of each session we use to take doubts.

@23F3002987_J_SRI_BAL ,

This must be a production deployment url, that’s why I am not able to access it.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web page displayed in a browser. The page is a Vercel access request page. It indicates that the user does not have permission to access a specific deployment URL.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **URL:** `https://vercel.com/sso/access/request?next=%2Fsso-api%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-proj...`
*   **Main Heading:** "Team Access Required"
*   **User Information:** "You are signed in as jivraj-18."
*   **Access Denial Message:** "You cannot access this unique deployment URL as you are not a member of the team. You can view the latest version of this branch by requesting access to the up-to-date deployment URL."
*   **Alternative Action:** "Log in with a different Vercel Account"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The purpose of the page is to inform the user that they do not have the necessary permissions to access a specific deployment on Vercel. This is likely because the deployment is restricted to members of a specific team, and the user's account is not part of that team. The page offers two options:

*   Request access to the "up-to-date deployment URL" (presumably a more public or accessible version).
*   Log in with a different Vercel account that might have the required permissions.

**4. Technical details (based on the URL and content):**

*   **Platform:** Vercel (a platform for deploying web applications and static websites).
*   **SSO:** The URL contains `/sso/access/request`, suggesting that Single Sign-On (SSO) is being used for authentication and authorization.
*   **Deployment URL:** The URL contains a fragment `vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-proj`, which is likely a unique identifier for the specific deployment that the user is trying to access.
*   **Access Control:** Vercel's team-based access control is in effect

Solution :

Go to vercel dashboard and select your project, and below domains you would find a url use that.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web interface, specifically a deployment dashboard from Vercel. It displays information about a "Production Deployment" for a project. The UI elements include:

*   A top navigation bar with options like "Project," "Deployments," "Analytics," "Logs," "Storage," and "Settings."
*   A main content area displaying deployment details.
*   A "Not Found" error message in a prominent section.
*   Deployment information, including the deployment URL, domains, status, creation date, and source.
*   Buttons for "Build Logs" and "Runtime Logs."

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Top Navigation:** "Project," "Deployments," "Analytics," "Speed Insights," "Logs," "Observability," "Firewall," "Storage," "Settings"
*   **Page Title:** "Production Deployment"
*   **Error Message:** "Not Found. The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again."
*   **Deployment Details:**
    *   "Deployment"
    *   "api-6xs8fp81c-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app"
    *   "Domains"
    *   "api-ruby-seven-48.vercel.app"
    *   "+2" (likely indicating additional domains)
    *   "Status"
    *   "Created"
    *   "Ready"
    *   "28 Jan by jivraj-18"
    *   "Source"
    *   "View code"
    *   "vercel deploy"
*   **Buttons:** "Build Logs," "Runtime Logs"

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows the status of a deployment on Vercel. The primary issue is that a "Not Found" error is displayed, indicating that the requested URL is not accessible. The rest of the information provides context about the deployment, such as its URL, associated domains, status, and source. The user is likely troubleshooting why the URL is returning a "Not Found" error.

**4. Technical details (based on the image):**

*

If this doesn’t solve problem, pls join tomorrow’s session between 8-10 towards ending of session we use to take doubts.

Kind regards

Jivraj

The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using `127.0.0.1` and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with `http://localhost:8000/api` to see if it works.

If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the `ipconfig` command to check the correct IP address.

We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.

If I entered the URL I get the error Failed to fetch

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) related to deploying a Python application to Vercel. It includes instructions, a code snippet, a URL input field, and an error message.

**2. Text Content:**

*   "Download this `q-vercel-python.json` which has the marks of 100 imaginary students."
*   "Create and deploy a Python app to Vercel. Expose an API so that when a request like `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/name-X&name-Y` is made, it returns a JSON response with the marks of the names X and Y like this:"
*   `"marks" 10 20`
*   "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin."
*   "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`"
*   `https://tdsproject1-ltjsdpii1-23f2003853-projects.vercel.app/api` (in the input field)
*   "TypeError: Failed to fetch"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image appears to be part of a tutorial or guide on how to deploy a Python application to Vercel and expose an API. The user is being instructed to create an API endpoint that returns JSON data based on parameters passed in the URL. The error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch" suggests that there's a problem with the URL provided or the API endpoint itself, preventing the data from being retrieved.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **Vercel:** The image refers to Vercel, a platform for deploying web applications.
*   **API:** The instructions involve creating an API (Application Programming Interface) endpoint.
*   **JSON:** The API is expected to return data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.
*   **CORS:** The instruction to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) indicates that the API is intended to be accessed from different origins (domains).
*   **URL Structure:** The example URL `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/name-X&name-

If I run the same in my browser, I get the output (just I tried for two name available in json file)

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser window. The browser appears to be Google Chrome, based on the UI elements. The main content area displays a JSON-like data structure.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Tab Titles:** The browser tabs are labeled with the following titles: "My Dashboard", "Graded Ass", "TOS 2025 Jx", "Vercel", "tdsproject1", "Introducing", "Deploy Pyn", and "tdsproject1".
*   **URL:** The address bar shows the URL: "tdsproject1-tjsdp1i-23f2003853-projects.vercel.app/api?name=sLrAoQ&name=d2KY"
*   **Content:** The main content area displays the following text:
    *   "Pretty-print" (with a checkbox next to it, which is unchecked)
    *   `{"marks":[1,41]}`

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image likely shows the output of an API endpoint. The URL suggests that the API is hosted on Vercel, a platform for deploying web applications. The API endpoint seems to be returning a JSON object containing a key "marks" which has a value that is a list (or array) containing the numbers 1 and 41. The "Pretty-print" checkbox suggests that the user has the option to format the JSON output for better readability.

**4. Technical details:**

*   **JSON:** The data `{"marks":[1,41]}` is in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. It's a common format for data interchange on the web.
*   **API Endpoint:** The URL indicates that the user is accessing an API endpoint. The parameters `name=sLrAoQ&name=d2KY` are likely being passed to the API to retrieve specific data.
*   **Vercel:** The URL contains "vercel.app," indicating that the application is deployed on the Vercel platform. Vercel is a popular platform for deploying serverless functions and static websites.

Kindly help me to fix the issue

you need to keep the services running. Else it will fail. Do whats required, regenerate that link and paste it once you complete and save it. this way you can avoid rework.

I was facing problem that how to make a class as variable name for Q9 in GA2 . but now i get a solution which was helpful for making class as variable. The below command is the solution for the problem of how to make a class variable name in python.

**Image: 1738356937481**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a screen capture of a Google Meet or similar video conferencing session. The main content is a code editor window, likely VS Code, displaying a Python file named "fast.py". There's also a tab for "data.csv", suggesting the code interacts with a CSV file. A smaller window in the lower right corner shows the presenter's (Saransh's) video feed. The bottom of the screen shows the standard Google Meet controls (mute, video, share, leave call).

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Code in `fast.py`:**
    *   `allow_credentials=True`
    *   `allow_methods=["*"], # Allows all HTTP methods.`
    *   `allow_headers=["*"], # Allows all headers.`
    *   `data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")`
    *   `@app.get("/api")`
    *   `async def root(class_name: List[str] = Query(default=[], alias="class")):`
    *   `population = int(data.query("city == @city")["population"].values[0])`
    *   `return {"city": city, "population": population}`
*   **Status Bar (VS Code):**
    *   `Ln 16, Col 31 Spaces: 4 UTF-8 CRLF {} Python 3.11.4 ('env': venv)`
    *   `Go Live Codeium: (...) Prettier`
*   **Other Text:**
    *   "Saransh is presenting"
    *   "FastAPI" (in the search bar)
    *   "10:31 PM Fri, Jan 31 G" (top left)
    *   "54%" (top right)
    *   "10:31 PM 31-01-2025" (bottom right)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows a coding session, likely a demonstration or presentation of a simple FastAPI application. The code reads data from a CSV file ("data.csv"), defines an API endpoint ("/api"), and returns a JSON response containing the city and

Hi Srividya,

Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.

When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.

This renders `name == main` part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).

In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You *do not* create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.

This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.

Thanks for your input.

Kind regards

Questions 9 and 10 require running a development server from my side. Right now, the questions are marked correct and I’ve saved the assignment. Since the servers won’t always be running, I hope this won’t cause a problem during evaluation.

What am i missing here? i am also facing same issue, question 9 . attached screenshots.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 6.15.03 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser window displaying two columns of JSON data. The data appears to be a list of student records, each containing a "class" and a "studentId". The two columns seem to be identical. The browser tabs at the top indicate the user is on a website called "jsondiff.com" and is likely comparing two JSON files.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Browser Tabs:**
    *   "TDS 2025 Jan GA2 -..."
    *   "docker hub - Google"
    *   "localhost:8000/api"
    *   "127.0.0.1:8000/api?c..."
    *   "JSON Diff - The sem..."
    *   "Graded Assignment..."
    *   "GA2 - Deployment To..."
    *   "Indian Institute of Tec..."
*   **Website Title:** "jsondiff.com"
*   **JSON Data:** The JSON data consists of objects with the following structure:
    *   `"class": "value"` (where value is "1N", "8N", "8X", or "42")
    *   `"studentId": number` (where number is an integer like 60, 64, 106, 270, 411, 522, 525, 673, 710, 802, 934, 1034, 1331, 1354, 1485, 1511, 1573, 1591, 1611, 1678, 1826, 1831)

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The context suggests that someone is using "jsondiff.com" to compare two JSON files. The data likely represents student information, possibly for a class or a school. The fact that the two columns are identical suggests that the comparison might be to verify that two versions of the data are the same, or perhaps the user is

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 6.13.02 PM**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser interface, likely related to a coding assignment or assessment. It displays a problem description, an input field for an API URL, an error message, a "Check" button, and the browser's developer tools (specifically the "Network" tab).

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Title/Context:** "TDS 2025 Jan GA2" and "Graded Assignment" suggest this is part of a graded task.
*   **Due Date:** "Due Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"
*   **Score:** "Score: 7.5 / 10"
*   **Instructions:**
    *   "If the URL has a query parameter class, it should return only students in those classes. For example, /api?class=1A should return only students in class 1A. /api?class=1A&class=1B should return only students in class 1A and 1B. There may be any number of classes specified. Return students in the same order as they appear in the CSV file (not the order of the classes)."
    *   "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin."
    *   "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api"
*   **User Input:** "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api" (This is the user's attempt at providing the API URL).
*   **Error Message:** "Error: Response undefined does not match expected [{"studentId":60,"class":"1N"},{"studentId":64,"class":"1N"}, {"studentId":106,"class":"1N"}, {"studentId":270,"class":"1N"}, {"studentId":411,"class":"8N"},{"studentId":522,"class":"8N"}, {"studentId":525,"class":"8X"},{"studentId":673,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":710,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":

Hi @23f2004644 and @bhashwar_sengupta ,

You would need to keep all the servers active whenever you click on save button.

So if I kept the server running and saved the answer, but after reloading it’s showing incorrect

We can’t just keep it running.

Hi @daksh76 ,

I didn’t actually used python to solve this particular question.  I tried for some time but it was not working. So I just used [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/), for now pls use this.

Hi @24ds1000082_Vivek, @23f3004114 ,

You guys are not using correct format for response.

{
  "students": [
    {
      "studentId": 1,
      "class": "1A"
    },
    {
      "studentId": 2,
      "class": "1B"
    }, ...
  ]
}

This is correct for which have a object with key `students` which is not present in your response.

kind regards

@ carlton @ Jivraj

Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem.

Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.

Do I need to do anything else ?

Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.

Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards.

Week-2 Question-8, I am getting error

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. UI Elements:**

*   **Text Input Field:** A text input field is present, outlined in red, suggesting an error or invalid input.
*   **Button:** A blue button labeled "Check" is located at the bottom left.
*   **Text Labels:** There are text labels providing instructions and error messages.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Question/Instruction:** "What is the Docker image URL? It should look like: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general"
*   **Input Value:** "https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/23f2000573/first-rep/general" (This is the value entered in the text input field.)
*   **Error Message:** "Error: 23f2000573 is not one of the tags in https://hub.docker.com/v2/namespaces/23f2000573/repositories/first-rep/tags"
*   **Button Label:** "Check"

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image shows a UI element where a user is asked to provide a Docker image URL. The expected format is given as an example. The user has entered a URL, but it's resulting in an error. The error message indicates that the part of the URL "23f2000573" is not a valid tag for the specified repository. The "Check" button likely triggers the validation of the entered URL.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **Docker Image URL:** The image deals with Docker image URLs, which are used to identify and locate Docker images in a registry (like Docker Hub).
*   **URL Structure:** The expected URL structure is: `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general`, where `$USER` is the Docker Hub username and `$REPO` is the repository name.
*   **Error:** The error message suggests that the provided URL is incorrect because the part of the URL that should represent a tag (likely "23f2000573") is not a valid tag for the repository "first-rep" under the namespace "23f200057

I have pushed my image in the repository, pulled it and ran once, it worked

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **What is shown in the image:** The image shows a command-line interface (CLI) or terminal window. It displays commands and output related to Docker.

2.  **Text content visible:**
    *   `giri@GIRI:~$` This is the command prompt, indicating the user "giri" is logged into a system named "GIRI". The `~$` suggests the user is in their home directory.
    *   `docker run 23f2000573/first-rep:v1` This is a Docker command. `docker run` starts a container from an image. `23f2000573/first-rep:v1` specifies the Docker image to use. The image name is `first-rep` with a tag `v1`, and it's located in a repository identified by `23f2000573`.
    *   `abc.py` This appears to be the output of the Docker container. It suggests that a Python script named "abc.py" was executed within the container.

3.  **Context or purpose:** The image shows the execution of a Docker container. The user is running a Docker image named `first-rep:v1`. The container, upon execution, seems to have run a Python script named `abc.py`. The purpose is likely to run a specific application or script within a controlled environment provided by Docker.

4.  **Technical details:**
    *   The `docker run` command is a fundamental Docker command used to create and start containers.
    *   The image name `23f2000573/first-rep:v1` follows the standard Docker image naming convention: `[repository/][image_name]:[tag]`.
    *   The output `abc.py` suggests that the Docker container is configured to execute this Python script by default or as part of its startup process.

This is how my docker hub repository looks,

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image is a screenshot of the Docker Hub website, specifically the page for a repository named "23f2000573/first-rep". It shows the repository's general information, tags, and options for automated builds. The UI elements include:

*   **Header:** Docker Hub logo, navigation links (Explore, Repositories, Organizations, Usage), search bar, keyboard shortcut indicator (ctrl+K), notification icons, and user profile information.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** Navigation path showing the current location within Docker Hub (23f2000573 / Repositories / first-rep / General).
*   **Repository Information:** Repository name, last pushed time, repository size, options to add a description and category.
*   **Tabs:** Navigation tabs for different sections of the repository (General, Tags, Builds, Collaborators, Webhooks, Settings).
*   **Tags Section:** A table displaying the tags associated with the repository.
*   **Automated Builds Section:** Information about connecting to GitHub or Bitbucket for automated builds.
*   **Docker Commands:** A section displaying the command to push a new tag to the repository.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Header:** "Docker Hub", "Explore", "Repositories", "Organizations", "Usage", "Search Docker Hub", "New More Docker. Easy Access. New Streamlined Plans. Learn more."
*   **Breadcrumbs:** "23f2000573 / Repositories / first-rep / General"
*   **Repository Information:** "23f2000573/first-rep", "Last pushed 19 minutes ago", "Repository size: 364.1 MB", "Add a description", "Add a category"
*   **Tabs:** "General", "Tags", "Builds", "Collaborators", "Webhooks", "Settings"
*   **Tags Section:** "Tags", "This repository contains 1 tag(s).", "Tag", "OS", "Type", "Pulled", "Pushed", "v1", "Image", "22 minutes ago", "22 minutes ago", "See all"
*   **Automated Builds Section

In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with `--n-gpu-layers 35` parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that.

@carlton @Jivraj did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. UI Elements:**

*   **Browser Window:** The image shows a portion of a web browser window. The address bar is visible at the top.
*   **Address Bar:** The address bar displays the URL: `new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api?name=Mn&name=m`
*   **Tabs:** There are multiple tabs open in the browser. The visible tabs include:
    *   `iitm-tds-project1/sc...` (likely a GitHub repository)
    *   `PROJECT2/autolysis....` (likely another GitHub repository)
    *   `Indian Institute of T...` (likely a website)
*   **Checkbox:** There is a checkbox labeled "Pretty-print".
*   **JSON Output:** Below the checkbox, there's a JSON string displayed.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **URL:** `new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api?name=Mn&name=m`
*   **Tab Titles:**
    *   `iitm-tds-project1/sc...`
    *   `PROJECT2/autolysis....`
    *   `Indian Institute of T...`
*   **Checkbox Label:** `Pretty-print`
*   **JSON Data:** `{"marks": [5,78]}`

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image likely shows the output of an API endpoint. The URL `new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api` suggests a deployment on Vercel. The query parameters `?name=Mn&name=m` indicate that the API is receiving a parameter named "name" with two different values. The JSON output `{"marks": [5,78]}` is the response from the API, indicating that it's returning a JSON object with a key "marks" whose value is an array containing the numbers 5 and 78. The "Pretty-print" checkbox suggests an option to format the JSON output for better readability.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **API Endpoint:** The API endpoint is likely written in a server-side language (e.g., Node.js, Python) and deployed on Vercel.
*

here it is giving output but when i run on question page it gives error.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a user interface (UI) element, likely part of a web application or form. It includes a text prompt, an input field, an error message, and a button.

**2. Text content visible:**

*   **Prompt:** "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api"
*   **Input Field:** "https://new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api"
*   **Error Message:** "Error: Expected [98,92,56,72,17] but got [48,"Not Found","Not Found","Not Found","Not Found"]"
*   **Button:** "Check"

**3. Context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The UI element is designed to collect a Vercel URL from the user. The prompt provides an example of the expected format. The input field allows the user to enter the URL. The error message indicates that the entered URL did not pass validation. The "Check" button likely triggers the validation process.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The error message suggests that the validation process is comparing the input against an expected array of values. The expected array is `[98,92,56,72,17]`. The actual array received is `[48,"Not Found","Not Found","Not Found","Not Found"]`. This implies that the validation logic is expecting specific numerical values at certain positions, and it's receiving either a different number or a "Not Found" string.
*   The fact that the error message includes "Not Found" suggests that the validation might be attempting to retrieve data from the provided URL, and it's failing to find the expected resources.
*   The URL format `https://your-app.vercel.app/api` indicates that the application is likely using Vercel for deployment and that it has an API endpoint.

please look into this @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini

Try these @21f3000745

Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy.

**If this doesn’t work, then:**
Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work.
Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.

Hi @24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ ,

For the **ngrok tunnel** question and any other question requiring a server URL, make sure to **keep all servers running** when clicking the **Save** button.

Also, I couldn’t find the **GitHub Pages URL** in your **GA2 response**, and many answers are unmarked. It seems you **didn’t click the Save button**.

Your current score is **4.5/10**.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-02 194815**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser window displaying a JSON response. The browser's address bar is visible at the top. The main content area shows a formatted JSON object.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Address Bar:** `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A`
*   **JSON Content:**
    *   `"students": [`
    *   `"studentId": 224,`
    *   `"class": "1A"`

    *   `"studentId": 1704,`
    *   `"class": "1A"`
*   **UI Element:** "Pretty-print" with a checkmark next to it.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows the response from an API endpoint. The endpoint is likely designed to return a list of students belonging to a specific class. The URL `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A` suggests that the API is running locally on port 8000, and the `class=1A` query parameter filters the results to only include students in class "1A". The JSON data represents an array of student objects, where each object contains the `studentId` and `class` of a student. The "Pretty-print" option suggests that the browser or an extension is formatting the JSON for better readability.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

*   **JSON:** The data is structured as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object. JSON is a common format for data interchange on the web.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-02 194801**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a section of a user interface, likely part of a web application or online course. It appears to be an interactive exercise or challenge related to building or testing an API. The UI elements include:

*   Text instructions and explanations.
*   An input field for entering a URL.
*   A "Check" button.
*   An error message.

**2. Text Content:**

The text content includes:

*   "If the URL has a query parameter `class`, it should return only students in those classes. For example, `/api?class=1A` should return only students in class 1A. `/api?class=1A&class=` should return only students in class 1A and 1B. There may be any number of classes specified. Return students in the same order as they appear in the CSV file (not the order of the classes)."
*   "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin."
*   "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`"
*   An input field containing: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
*   "TypeError: Failed to fetch"
*   "We'll check by sending a request to this URL with `?class=...` added and check if the response matches the data."
*   "Check" (on a button)

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The context is likely a tutorial or exercise where the user is expected to provide the correct API endpoint for a FastAPI application. The instructions explain how the API should handle a `class` query parameter, specifying that it should filter students based on the provided class(es). The CORS requirement suggests that the API needs to be configured to allow cross-origin requests. The "Check" button probably triggers a test that sends a request to the provided URL and verifies the response. The "TypeError: Failed to fetch" message indicates that the application was unable to connect to the provided URL.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   **API Endpoint:** The user is asked to provide the API endpoint for a FastAPI application. FastAPI

Hi @23f2000573 ,

As error mentions to add tag to image.

Adding different tags is like versioning your docker image, image with a particular tag can be pulled.

For adding tag use

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **What is shown in the image:** The image displays a set of commands, likely intended to be executed in a terminal or command-line interface. These commands are related to building, running, and deploying a container using `podman`, a container management tool. The commands are presented in a code-like format with comments explaining their purpose.

2.  **Text content visible:**
    *   "To build, run, and deploy the container, run these commands:"
    *   "# Create an account on https://hub.docker.com/ and then login"
    *   "podman login docker.io"
    *   "# Build and run the container"
    *   "podman build -t py-hello ."
    *   "podman run -it py-hello"
    *   "# Push the container to Docker Hub. Replace $DOCKER\_HUB\_USERNAME with your Docker Hub username."
    *   "podman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER\_HUB\_USERNAME/py-hello"
    *   "# Push adding a specific tag, e.g. dev"
    *   "TAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER\_HUB\_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG"

3.  **Context or purpose:** The content provides instructions on how to build, run, and deploy a containerized application named "py-hello" using `podman`. It includes steps for logging into Docker Hub, building the container image, running the container, and pushing the image to Docker Hub with a specific tag. The instructions also highlight the need to replace the `$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` placeholder with the user's actual Docker Hub username.

4.  **Technical details:**
    *   The commands use `podman`, which is a container engine similar to Docker.
    *   `podman login docker.io` logs into the Docker Hub registry.
    *   `podman build -t py-hello .` builds a container image named "py-hello" from the current directory (indicated by the `.`).
    *   `podman run -it py-hello` runs the container in interactive mode.
    *   `podman push py-hello:latest

For GA2 there is not question that asks if you visited GA2 page or not.

Just answer on GA2 page [TDS 2025 Jan GA2 - Deployment Tools](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2#hq-docker-hub-image).

Hi @24f1002359

For **Question 10**, ensure that **all servers are running** every time you submit (click the **Save** button). Since **ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs**, double-check that the **ngrok URL is correct** before submitting.

For **Question 9**, did you **enable CORS**? To verify, check your **browser console**—if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser's developer tools console. The console is displaying log messages and an error message. The tabs at the top indicate that the developer tools are open, and the "Console" tab is currently selected.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The console displays the following text:

*   "starting ajax request to the resource."
*   "ajax request done."
*   "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://google.com/' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."

The text is accompanied by links to the source code file and line number where the messages originated:

*   index.html:14
*   index.html:29
*   index.html:1

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The console output indicates that an AJAX request was initiated and completed. However, an error occurred due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy. The error message states that the request to `http://google.com/` was blocked because the server at `google.com` did not include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its response. The origin of the request is reported as 'null', which often happens when the code is run from a local file (e.g., directly from an HTML file opened in the browser).

**4. Technical details:**

*   **AJAX:** Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages. AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes.
*   **XMLHttpRequest:** The XMLHttpRequest object is a browser API that allows JavaScript to make HTTP requests to a server.
*   **CORS:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a browser security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one which served the web page. This is to prevent malicious websites from accessing sensitive data from other websites.
*   **Access-Control-Allow-Origin:** This is an HTTP response header that the server can use to indicate which origins (domains) are allowed to access its resources. If the header is not present,

For question 5, I have tried executed script with your set of parameters, your answer is correct. Will discuss it internally.

Kind regards.

for question 9 u can use ,

`from fastapi import FastAPI, Query`

and

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

1.  **What is shown in the image:** The image shows a snippet of Python code. It appears to be defining an API endpoint using a framework like FastAPI or Flask.

2.  **Text content:**
    *   `@app.get("/api")`
    *   `def api(class_: Annotated[list[str] | None, Query(alias='class')] = None,`

3.  **Context/Purpose:** The code defines an API endpoint at the path "/api". The `api` function likely handles requests to this endpoint. The `class_` parameter is annotated with type information, indicating it can be a list of strings or None. It also uses `Query` from a library like `fastapi` to define it as a query parameter with an alias of 'class'. This suggests the API can accept a query parameter named "class".

4.  **Technical Details:**
    *   `@app.get("/api")`: This is a decorator that associates the `api` function with the HTTP GET method for the "/api" endpoint.
    *   `def api(...)`: This defines a function named `api`.
    *   `class_: Annotated[list[str] | None, Query(alias='class')] = None`: This defines a parameter named `class_` with type hints.
        *   `Annotated`: This is likely used for adding metadata to the type hint.
        *   `list[str] | None`: This indicates that the parameter can be a list of strings or None.
        *   `Query(alias='class')`: This specifies that the parameter is a query parameter and its alias is 'class'. This means the parameter will be extracted from the query string of the request.
        *   `= None`: This sets the default value of the parameter to None.

I am facing this issue. It is stating the error as mentioned

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a snippet of text and code related to testing an API endpoint. It includes:

*   **Instructions:** Text explaining how the API should behave when a query parameter `class` is used.
*   **Example API URL:** A suggested URL for the FastAPI endpoint.
*   **API Request/Response:** An attempt to call the API and the resulting error message.

**2. Text Content:**

*   "If the URL has a query parameter `class`, it should return only students in those classes. For example, `/api?class=1A` should return only students in class 1A. `/api?class=1A&class=1B` should return only students in class 1A and 1B. There may be any number of classes specified. Return students in the same order as they appear in the CSV file (not the order of the classes)."
*   "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin."
*   "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`"
*   `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` (This is likely an input field or a display of the API endpoint being tested).
*   "Error: Response \[...]" (Followed by a long JSON string representing the API response).
*   "does not match expected \[...]" (Indicates a mismatch between the actual and expected API response).
*   "We'll check by sending a request to this URL with `?class=...` added and check if the response matches the data."

The JSON string contains an array of objects. Each object represents a student and has two keys: `"studentId"` (an integer) and `"class"` (a string).

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image captures a scenario where someone is testing an API endpoint that retrieves student data based on class. The API is expected to filter students based on the `class` query parameter. The error message indicates that the API is not returning the expected data for a given query, suggesting a bug in the API implementation or the test itself. The instructions emphasize the importance

The /api is working perfectly fine manually either I specify the class or without it

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser window displaying JSON data. The data appears to be a list of student records, where each record contains a "studentId" and a "class" assignment. The JSON is formatted in a "pretty-print" style, making it more readable.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Browser Address Bar:** `127.0.0.1:8000/api`
*   **Tab Title:** "Pretty-print"
*   **JSON Data:** The JSON data consists of a top-level object with a single key "students". The value associated with "students" is an array of objects. Each object in the array has two key-value pairs:
    *   `"studentId"`: An integer representing the student's ID (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ..., 252).
    *   `"class"`: A string representing the class assigned to the student (e.g., "10J", "7K", "2G", "10Q", "4W", "10H", etc.).

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image likely shows the output of an API endpoint (`/api`) that returns student data in JSON format. The purpose is probably to provide a structured data representation of students and their class assignments, which can be consumed by other applications or services. The "pretty-print" formatting suggests that this is intended for human readability, possibly for debugging or inspection purposes.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

*   **JSON Structure:** The JSON data follows a standard structure with a root object containing a "students" array. Each element in the array is a JSON object with "studentId" and "class" keys.
*   **API Endpoint:** The URL `127.0.0.1:8000/api` indicates that the data is being served from a local development server (localhost) on port 8000. The `/api` path suggests that this is an API endpoint.
*   **Data Types:** The "studentId" values are integers, and the "class" values are strings

Sample class example that I tried manually is below

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser window displaying JSON data. The browser's address bar is visible, and the content area shows a formatted JSON string. The bottom of the image shows the Windows taskbar.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Browser Address Bar:** `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=3Q`
*   **JSON Data:**
    ```json
    {"students":[{"studentId":68,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":838,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":902,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":1096,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":1623,"class":"3Q"},
    {"studentId":1784,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":1834,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":1893,"class":"3Q"},{"studentId":1931,"class":"3Q"}]}
    ```
*   **Browser Tab Title:** `Pretty-print`
*   **Taskbar:** Shows system information like CPU usage (90%), GPU usage (25%), RAM usage (97%), date (02-02-2025), and time (22:46).

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image shows the output of an API endpoint. The API is likely designed to return a list of students belonging to a specific class. The `class` parameter in the URL is set to "3Q". The JSON data represents an array of student objects, where each object contains a `studentId` and a `class` field.

**4. Technical details (JSON data):**

*   The JSON data is a dictionary (object) with a single key: `"students"`.
*   The value associated with `"students"` is an array.
*   Each element in the array is a dictionary (object) representing a student.
*   Each student object has two keys: `"studentId"` (an integer) and `"class"` (a string, always "3Q" in this case).
*   The student IDs are: 68, 83

The main code is below

import sys

sys.path.append("C:\\Users\\Deveshu Pathak\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\\LocalCache\\local-packages\\Python312\\Scripts")
# tds_q9.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import pandas as pd

app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  
    allow_headers=["*"],  
)

# Load CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("q-fastapi.csv")

@app.get("/api")
def get_students(class_: list[str] = Query(None, alias="class")):
    if class_:
        filtered_df = df[df["class"].isin(class_)]
    else:
        filtered_df = df

    # Convert to dictionary list
    students = filtered_df.to_dict(orient="records")
    return {"students": students}

The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen.

If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list.

I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.

I had submitted the assignment in the evening, but now in the portal it’s showing not submitted.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a UI element, specifically a list of recent saves. Each save entry has a "Reload" button and information about the save.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Title:** "Recent saves"
*   **Save Entries:** Each entry contains:
    *   A "Reload" button.
    *   The text "from" followed by a date and time (e.g., "02/02/2025, 18:21:07").
    *   The text "Score:" followed by a numerical score (e.g., "10" or "8.5").

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The UI element is likely part of a game or application that allows users to save their progress. The "Recent saves" list provides a way for users to quickly reload a previously saved state.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The UI appears to be designed with a dark theme.
*   The "Reload" buttons are likely interactive elements that trigger the loading of the corresponding save.
*   The date and time format is "MM/DD/YYYY, HH:MM:SS".
*   The scores are numerical values, with at least one entry showing a decimal value.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a UI element, likely from an online learning platform or course management system. It displays information about an assignment within a specific module. The layout includes columns for "Assignment," "Your Score," "Peer Average," and "Median Score."

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Module 2: Deployment Tools:** This is the title of the module.
*   **Assignment:** This is a column header.
*   **Graded Assignment 2:** This is the name of the assignment.
*   **Assessment (Due: 2 Feb 2025):** This indicates that the item is an assessment and provides the due date.
*   **Not Submitted:** This indicates that the assignment has not been submitted.
*   **Your Score:** This is a column header.
*   **Peer Average:** This is a column header.
*   **Median Score:** This is a column header.
*   **-**: This is displayed under each score column, indicating that no score is available.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The purpose is to provide a student with an overview of their assignment status and performance relative to their peers. The student can see the assignment name, due date, submission status, their score (if available), the average score of their peers, and the median score.

**4. Technical details:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web-based interface. The layout is tabular, with clear column headings. The use of "Not Submitted" in red text likely serves as a visual cue to the student. The absence of scores (represented by hyphens) suggests that either the assignment hasn't been graded yet, or the student hasn't submitted it. The presence of peer average and median score columns implies that the system tracks and displays aggregate performance data.

We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students.

If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

TDS TA

Yes. The scores you achieve in the TDS portal are your scores for the GA. It’s not necessary to do anything on the Seek Portal.

Actually even on the portal it’s showing like this:

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser window displaying a quiz or assignment interface. It appears to be part of an online course or program. The UI elements include:

*   Browser tabs with titles like "Outline :: IITM Online Degree", "Tools in Data Science", "TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development", and "GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discu".
*   A red banner at the top indicating the assignment's end date and time.

*   "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"
*   "Score: 0"
*   "Check all"
*   "Save"
*   "7. It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed."
*   "Should you take TDS this term?"
*   "If this assignment takes you under 2 hours to complete, you will likely do OK in TDS."
*   "If you score above 8 / 10, you might get an S or A grade, with effort and luck."
*   "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse"
*   "You are logged in as 22f2001630@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."
*   "Logout"
*   "Recent saves"
*   "Reload from 

So it’s confusing.
