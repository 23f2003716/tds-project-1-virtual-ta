Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread
Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments
Why?  :interrobang:  :thinking: 

If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?

Too many Questions for LLM  :nerd_face:  :nerd_face:  :nerd_face: 

True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer

What We need from YOU ü´µüèΩ

Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it?

How?

If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work
If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful  :+1:t3:  :+1:t3: 

Where? :thinking:  :man_shrugging:t3:  :man_shrugging:t3:

      # TDS-Project2-QuestionBank
Question Bank for all TDS assignments

# Requested format
## Student Assignments Directory Structure

Each student has a folder named with their roll number. Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:
- A `.txt` file with the question statement.
- A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution.

### Example Directory Structure
RollNo_12345/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assignment_1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q1.txt    # Question for Q1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q1.py     # Solution in Python
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q2.txt    # Question for Q2
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q2.sh     # Solution in Bash
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q3.txt    # Question for Q3
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Q3.js     # Solution in JavaScript
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assignment_2/

This time I‚Äôll create a functioning script way before deadline for everyone to use .

**Image: OnePieceStrawhatsGIF**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a pirate flag waving in the wind against a blue sky with scattered white clouds. The flag is attached to a wooden mast.

**2. Any text content visible:**

There is no text visible in the image.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The image depicts a pirate flag, specifically the Jolly Roger associated with the Straw Hat Pirates from the anime and manga series "One Piece." The flag features a skull and crossbones design, but with a distinctive straw hat on the skull's head. This is the symbol of the main character, Monkey D. Luffy, and his crew.

**4. Technical details if it's a code screenshot or technical diagram:**

This is not a code screenshot or technical diagram. It's an illustration or animation frame. The style suggests it's from an anime or cartoon.
