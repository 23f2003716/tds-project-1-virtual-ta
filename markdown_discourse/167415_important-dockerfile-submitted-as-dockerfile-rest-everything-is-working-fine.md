I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.

Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check other sections of your submission like

Is the GitHub repo public?
Does it have an MIT license?
Does it have a DockerFile?
Is the Docker image accessible?

Oh ok made the changes in Github. I hope submitting again is not required since the links and names are same.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. Content:**

The image contains two lines of text. The first line appears to be a list of error messages or warnings. The second line is a statement about submission requirements.

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Line 1:** "No such repo; No "MIT" in LICENSE; No Dockerfile"
*   **Line 2:** "Please ensure that your submission passes the above checklist for it to be even considered for scoring."

**3. Context/Purpose:**

The image likely represents feedback or a requirement for a submission (e.g., code, project, assignment). The first line indicates that the submission is missing a repository, doesn't have an MIT license specified in the LICENSE file, and lacks a Dockerfile. The second line emphasizes the importance of meeting these requirements for the submission to be evaluated.

**4. Technical Details:**

The text suggests a software development or deployment context. The terms "repo," "LICENSE," and "Dockerfile" are common in software projects. The "MIT" license is a permissive open-source license. A "Dockerfile" is used to define a Docker container, which is a standardized way to package and run applications.

Sir, i got this mail. I have checked that the repo is public and already has a Dockerfile.

I have renamed the ‘LICENSE’ file as ‘MIT LICENSE’.

Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.

Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.

Sir it is a humble request to please consider it.

Warm Regards,

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a file explorer or project directory structure, likely from a code repository or development environment. It shows a list of files and folders with associated metadata.

**2. Text Content:**

The following text is visible:

*   **Folders:**
    *   Business
    *   Operations
    *   app
*   **Files:**
    *   Dockerfile
    *   LICENSE
    *   README.md
*   **Descriptions/Commit Messages:**
    *   Reconfigured taskB8 taskB9 taskB10
    *   Reconfigured taskA8 taskA9 taskA10
    *   Updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt
    *   Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile
    *   MIT License
    *   Project Structure
*   **Timestamps:**
    *   2 days ago (appears three times)
    *   yesterday
    *   3 days ago (appears twice)
*   **Partial Text:**
    *   Re

**3. Context and Purpose:**

The image likely represents a view of a project's file structure within a version control system (like Git) or a code editor. The descriptions next to the files and folders seem to be commit messages or summaries of recent changes. The timestamps indicate when the files or folders were last modified.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The presence of a `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt` suggests that this project involves containerization (using Docker) and Python dependencies.
*   The `LICENSE` file indicates the project's licensing terms (in this case, MIT License).
*   The `README.md` file is a common convention for providing project documentation.
*   The "Reconfigured task..." messages suggest some kind of task management or configuration changes within the project.
