    We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students. 
If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time.

Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.

**The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.** Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists.

As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.

Kind regards

**Image: Screenshot (313)**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows a web browser interface, specifically a page for a graded assignment. It appears to be an online quiz or exam. The page includes instructions, a discussion link, login information, recent saves, and a section for questions (though the questions themselves are not visible in the cropped area).

**2. Text Content:**

*   **Page Title:** "Graded Assignment 3 :: IITM On" and "TDS 2025 Jan GA3 - Large Lang"
*   **URL:** "exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3"
*   **Status:** "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"
*   **Score:** "Score: 0"
*   **Buttons:** "Check all", "Save", "Reload", "Logout"
*   **Instructions:**
    *   "Browser may struggle. If you face loading issues, turn off security restrictions or try a different browser."
    *   "Use anything. You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want."
    *   "It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed."
    *   "Note: You'll run multiple servers in this exam. All of them must be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers."
*   **Discussion Link:** "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse"
*   **Login Information:** "You are logged in as 23f3004066@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."
*   **Recent Saves:**
    *   "from 2/1/2025, 4:06:41 PM. Score: 8"
    *   "from 2/1/2025, 4:06:37 PM. Score: 8"
    *   "from 2/1/2025, 4:06:32 PM. Score: 8"
*   **Section

Dear Bhavanagv,

The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated externally from the seek portal.

Kind regards

I had submitted the assignment still it’s shwoing that my score is 0 and that i have not submitted the assignment.

Can you please look into it as i had saved my answers as well timely.

**Image: image**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image displays a UI element, specifically a list of recent save files. It appears to be from a game or application that allows users to save their progress. The list is presented within a dark green box.

**2. Any text content visible:**

*   **Title:** "Recent saves"
*   **Save Entries:** Each entry has the following structure:
    *   "Reload" (likely a button or link)
    *   "from 2/2/2025, [Time] PM. Score: 4" (e.g., "from 2/2/2025, 9:04:58 PM. Score: 4")

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The purpose is to provide the user with a quick way to access and reload their recent save files. This is a common feature in games and applications to allow users to revert to a previous state.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The UI elements are likely buttons or links, indicated by the "Reload" text within a blue border.
*   The save information includes the date and time of the save, as well as a "Score" value, which is consistently "4" in all displayed saves. This suggests the score might be a game-specific metric.
*   The consistent date (2/2/2025) and close times suggest the saves were made in quick succession.
*   The UI is designed with a dark theme, using dark green and blue colors.

There are some errors in grading for GA2 and  GA3 for TDS, even after submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.

**Image: Screenshot 2025-02-07 201316**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. Overall Content:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web interface for an online exam or quiz. It shows information about the exam's status, instructions, login details, and recent save history.

**2. UI Elements:**

*   **Header:** Displays the exam's end time ("Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"), the current score ("Score: 0"), and buttons for "Check all" and "Save".
*   **Instructions:** A numbered list provides instructions and guidelines for the exam.
*   **Question/Discussion Link:** A section with a speech bubble icon and the text "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse". This likely links to a forum or discussion board for the exam.
*   **Login Information:** Displays the user's login ID ("You are logged in as 23f2000232@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.") and a "Logout" button.
*   **Recent Saves:** A section titled "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" lists the user's recent save history, including the date/time and score for each save. Each save entry has a "Reload" button.

**3. Text Content:**

*   **Exam Status:** "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"
*   **Score:** "Score: 0"
*   **Instructions:**
    *   "Learn what you need. Reading material is provided, but feel free to skip it if you can answer the question. (Or learn it, just for pleasure.)"
    *   "Check answers regularly by pressing Check. It shows which answers are right or wrong. You can check multiple times."
    *   "Save regularly by pressing Save. You can save multiple times. Your last saved submission will be evaluated."
    *   "Reloading is OK. Your answers are saved in your browser (not server). Questions won't change except for randomized parameters."
    *   "Browser may struggle. If you face loading issues, turn off security restrictions or try a different browser."
    *   "Use anything. You can use any resources you want. The Internet

and the same happened for the 3rd assignment

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as **4.25**, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored **7.25** shown after submission.

Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.

Hi Satish,

Your last submitted score is the only valid score. You have to check before submitting that the score is correct. There is a reload button to load previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last saved score is correct.

Kind regards
