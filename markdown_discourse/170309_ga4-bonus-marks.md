Sir,

I havenâ€™t received bonus marks in ga4 as, i posted queries in discourse regarding ga4. I have scored 8 marks in ga4, but after bonus marks it should be 9, but in dashboard it is showing only 80 marks.

Kindly, update my marks in dashboard.

Hi @Sakshi6479,

You have not followed the instruction in GA4 for the bonus mark.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**1. What is shown in the image:**

The image shows text content, specifically instructions or an announcement related to a course or assignment. It appears to be a snippet from a webpage or document.

**2. Any text content visible:**

The text content is as follows:

*   **Bonus marks for posting on Discourse** (This is the title or heading)
*   To encourage discussions, IITM BS students who reply to the discussion on **GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread \[TDS Jan 2025]** with a **relevant** question or reply will get 1 bonus mark on this graded assignment.

**3. The context or purpose of what's displayed:**

The purpose of the text is to incentivize students (specifically IITM BS students) to participate in a discussion forum (Discourse) related to a topic called "GA4 - Data Sourcing". Students who post a relevant question or reply in the specified discussion thread will receive a bonus mark on a graded assignment. The discussion thread is labeled with "[TDS Jan 2025]", suggesting it's related to a course or module called TDS and is active around January 2025.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The text "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread \[TDS Jan 2025]" is underlined, suggesting it might be a hyperlink.
*   The word "relevant" is in bold.
*   The background color is a light green.
*   The text is in a dark green color.

We were given the list by Anand for all those that followed this instruction.

That is why you have not received the bonus mark for GA4.

Kind regards
